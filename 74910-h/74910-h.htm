    FOR PLACING THEM.</h3>

  <h3 class="subheadc">1st. <em>An Account of the Plates.</em></h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft">1. (<em>a</em>)</span> A <em>Circular View from the Balloon at its greatest
    Elevation</em>, (<a href="#i_058">Page 58</a>.) The Spectator is supposed to be in
    the Car of the Balloon, suspended above the <em>Center</em> of the
    View: looking <em>down</em> on the Amphitheatre or <em>white</em> Floor
    of Clouds, and seeing the <em>City of Chester</em>, as it appeared
    throu’ the <em>Opening</em>: which discovers the Landscape <em>below</em>,
    limited, by surrounding Vapour, to something less than <em>two</em> Miles
    in Diameter.</p>

  <p>The Breadth of the <em>blue</em> Margin <em>defines</em> the
    <em>apparent</em> Height of the Spectator in the Balloon (viz. 4 Miles)
    <em>above</em> the <em>white</em> Floor of Clouds, as he hangs in the
    Center, and looks <em>horizontally</em> round, into the <em>azure</em> Sky.</p>

  <p>2. (<em>b</em>) <em>The Balloon over Helsbye-Hill in Cheshire</em>, at half
    past II. on Thursday the 8th of September, 1785. (<a href="#i_078">Page 78</a>.)</p>

  <p>It is seen in the <em>South-west-Quarter</em>.</p>

  <p>The View was taken in a <em>high</em> Field, at the End of
    Sutton-Causeway.</p>

  <p>Helsbye-Hill, tho’ upwards of 600 <em>Feet high</em>, appeared from the
    Car of the Balloon, to be on the <em>same Level</em> with the <em>Grounds
    below</em>.</p>

  <p>3. (<em>c</em>) <em>A Balloon-Prospect from above the Clouds</em>, (<a href="#i_154">Page 154,</a>) or <em>Chromatic</em> View of the Country between Chester,
    Warrington and Rixton-Moss in Lancashire: shewing the whole Extent of
    the aërial Voyage; with the <em>meandering</em> Track of the Balloon
    throu’ the Air.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">V</span></p>

  <p>4. <em>The Explanatory Print</em> (<em>d</em>), (<a href="#i_155">Page 155</a>:) which
    elucidates the former by giving the Names of the principal Places
    mentioned in the Excursion.</p>

  <p>N.&nbsp;B. <em>The Circular View</em> is seen to the best Advantage, when
    placed <em>flat</em> on a Table or Chair, and <em>rather</em> in the Shade:
    the Eye looking <em>directly</em> down upon the Picture.</p>

  <p>Whoever will be at the Trouble of viewing <em>distinct</em> Parts of the
    <em>Balloon-Prospect</em>, throu’ a very small Opening, made by rolling
    a Sheet of Paper into the Form of a hollow Tube, and applying it close
    to either Eye, at the same Time shutting the other; or by looking
    throu’ the Hand, held a little open, and close to the Eye; may form a
    very accurate Idea of the Manner, in which the <em>Prospect below</em>
    was represented <em>gradually in Succession</em>, to the Aironaut; whose
    Sight was bounded by a Circularity of Vapour, as in Section <a href="#section_79">79</a>, <a href="#section_221">221</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Introduction.</div>
  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_1">Section 1.</span> THE Public have, for a considerable Time, been entertained
    with Accounts of aërial Voyages.</p>

  <p>Such Accounts are, in many Respects, vague and unsatisfactory: by no
    Means adequate to the Expectations and Wishes, which have been formed
    by those, who have not yet penetrated the profound Heights of the
    Atmosphere.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Mistakes to be noticed, as Examples of Avoidance.</div>
  <p id="section_2">2. The Voyagers have, now and then, been pretty accurate in Regard
    to Time Place Distance and Velocity: Circumstances highly worthy of
    Remark, in order to estimate the Improvement already made in this
    wonderful Discovery, and point out its Use: but neither ought the
    <em>several Occasions of Failure</em> in the Experiments <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>to be omitted;
    as they will be found to arise more from a Want of Prudence and
    Foresight in the Managers, than from any Defect in the Machine, or the
    Principle on which it acts. Such Failure ought therefore to throw an
    additional Light and Credit on the Art: and give a Spur to Ingenuity,
    which, it is not to be doubted, will continue to drive forwards with
    the same rapid Success; nor rest, till the Art itself is brought to
    the highest Degree of Perfection; till airostatic Ships make the
    Circuit of the Globe: a <em class="smcap">Navigation</em> which, from its Novelty and
    Importance, deserves to be considered in a separate Treatise.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Aërial Voyagers defective in their Descriptions.</div>

  <p id="section_3">3. Balloon-Voyagers have likewise been particularly defective in
    their Descriptions of aërial Scenes and Prospects: those Scenes of
    majestic Grandeur which the unnumbered Volumes of encircling Clouds,
    in most fantastic Forms and various Hues, beyond Conception glowing
    and transparent, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>portray to a Spectator placed as in a Center of
    the Blue Serene above them: contemplating at the same Instant, and
    <em>apparently</em> at some Miles Distance immediately below, a most
    exquisite and ever-varying Miniature of the <em>little Works of Man</em>,
    heightened by the supreme Pencil of Nature, inimitably elegant, and in
    her highest Colouring.</p>

  <p>Such are the Scenes which, Ballooners all allow, constitute the true
    Sublime and Beautiful: inspire Ideas of rational Humiliation to a
    thinking Mind, and raise the most careless Mortal to an unknown Degree
    of enthusiastic Rapture and Pleasure.</p>

  <p>Every Beholder is a Judge of the Scenery around him: and no one, it
    is presumed, ever ascended into the Atmosphere on a <em>mild Day</em>,
    with a sound and well ballasted Balloon, that did not wish to taste the
    Luxury of a second Voyage.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Disappointment shoud excite the Ardor of the Scientific.</div>

  <p id="section_4">4. Yet notwithstanding, as Ignorance is known to be the Parent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    Fear, the Bulk of Mankind, which are by far the greater Number, will
    long continue to entertain absurd Apprehensions concerning it; to
    oppose and ridicule the Invention; as they will oppose every other
    Discovery, which they have neither Talents <em>Inclination</em> or
    Leisure to understand.</p>

  <p>This Reflexion shoud, on the contrary, rather excite than check the
    Ardor of the Skilful and Scientific, to cherish and promote the Art.</p>

  <p>In the History of Airostation, each Event is yet new and
    <em>uncompared</em>. <em>Every</em> Circumstance ought therefore to be
    carefully recorded: since it woud be unfair to fix Bounds to Science;
    or argue, that such Inferences, as shall demonstrate the great Utility
    of the Invention, may not be drawn from Circumstances which Inattention
    might pronounce to be most trifling and minute.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Reader cautioned.</div>

  <p id="section_5">5. The Reader is requested to observe that, this Account being
    addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> to the Generality, and not to the Curious and Philosophic
    only; many Circumstances are added, which woud otherwise have been
    considered as superfluous: and some it was thought proper to repeat, in
    order to connect the Thread of the Narration, without the Necessity of
    frequent Reference to the Sections.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Squalls of Wind the Day preceding the Ascent.</div>

  <p id="section_6">6. An Agreement having been made with Mr. Lunardi, that he shoud
    resign his Balloon to Mr. Baldwin on Wednesday the 7th of September;
    an Advertisement to that Purpose appeared in the Chester Paper: and
    on Wednesday Morning, a great Number of Spectators assembled in the
    Castle-yard of the City of Chester: where many waited till half past
    IV in the Afternoon; Mr. Lunardi declaring that, on Account of the
    Violence and Unsteadiness of the Wind which blew from the South and
    South-West, it was dangerous to attempt the Inflation of his Balloon;
    and Mr. Baldwin continuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> to assert that, if it coud be filled, he
    was willing to go up.</p>

  <p>The Weather was <em>then</em> moderate: but Mr. Baldwin, thinking the
    Hour too late to begin the Inflation, which, judging from the two
    former Inflations, coud not probably have been completed till after
    <em>Sunset</em>; made a Proposal to Mr. Lunardi, that he shoud postpone
    the Exhibition till the next&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <em>Day</em>. The latter,
    after some Reluctance, arising from a Fear lest the Public shoud disapprove his
    Conduct, politely complied with his Request, on Mr. Baldwin’s saying
    that he woud take the Blame on himself.</p>

  <p>Till VIII that Morning, the Air had been hazy: but was then clear,
    bright and calm <em>below</em>, with an upper Tier of light Clouds in the
    Zenith moving from South-West by West, and dense ones rising in the
    Horizon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">At X, the Inflation began with a small Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_8">8. At X o’Clock, the Process began with the Inflation of an airostatic
    Globe eighteen Feet in Circumference, of Silk Tiffany, made the latter
    End of the Year 1783, and decorated with Painting, Mottoes and Devices:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    in the Performance of which little Work, Mr. Baldwin was (in the
    modern Phrase) the sole Projector, Architect Workman and Chymist.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">An airostatic Globe liberated as Pioneer to the great one.</div>

  <p id="section_9">9. The Airostat was presently liberated by the Hands of Mr. Lunardi;
    and continuing to turn gently the same Way round its own Axis, afforded
    a beautiful Spectacle to the Beholders: remaining in Sight about half
    an Hour. It was intended to serve as a Sort of Pioneer, to delineate
    the Track of the great Balloon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Its Fate.</div>

  <p id="section_10">10. It fell at some Miles Distance, ’tis said unfortunately on a Hedge,
    and was presently torn to Pieces by the Eagerness and Avarice of the
    Pursuers, who expected and undeservedly obtained the Reward promised in
    the Letter appended to it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Second Cannon at XII.</div>

  <p id="section_11">11. At XII the Cannon fired a second Time, to announce that the Process
    was in a proper Degree of Forwardness.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <p>At this Time Mr. Baldwin went, with some Friends, to take an early
    Dinner: he also recapitulated the Articles, to be certain that Nothing
    was omitted.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Inventory for the Voyage.</div>

  <p id="section_12">12. The following Inventory, with which he ascended, may be of Use to
    future Aironauts; to whom <em>only</em> it is addressed.</p>

  <p>The Cable and Grapple are considered as Part of the Balloon. (See
    <a href="#section_13">Section 13</a>.)</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>12. Article 1. A portable Barometer,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with a common
      Syphon or
      Bulb, (purchased at Lausanne.)</p>

    <p>12. 2. Martin’s Thermometer,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> with Farenheit’s
      Scale&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for the
      Degrees of Temperature.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

    <p>12. 3. Mariner’s Compass in a double Box, to be used when the
      Sun is intercepted from the View by Clouds, in order to discover
      whether the Balloon turns round.</p>

    <p>12. 4. Down, or small Feathers, to be loose in the Pocket, and
      thrown out, when enshrined in Clouds; or at any other Time, to shew
      the Rise or Fall of the Balloon.</p>

    <p>12. 5. An Asses’ Skin Patent Pocket-book; as Wet spoils Paper.</p>

    <p>12. 6. Two <em>red</em> Lead Pencils: each Pencil ready pointed at
      both Ends, to save Time and Trouble: preferable to Ink, which may
      be spilt or frozen.</p>

    <p>The Strokes with <em>red</em> Lead are not so easily obliterated, as
      when made with a <em>black</em> Lead Pencil.</p>

    <p>12. 7. A small sharp Knife pointed, and ready open, or which will
      open easily. A Pair of Scissars.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

    <p>12. 8. A <em>wicker</em> Bottle of Brandy and Water, only three Parts
      full, half and half: such Bottles are more secure: and such Mixture
      will not soon freeze. The cochuc or elastic Bottle is still better.
      A Cork-screw.</p>

    <p>12. 9. <em>Compact</em> Provisions, which do not soil the Fingers or
      Pocket-book, as Confectionaries, Fruit, Biscuit, Bread.</p>

    <p>12. 10. A <em>boarded</em> Map of the Country over which the Aironaut
      may be supposed to pass: the Back serving as a Table.</p>

    <p>12. 11. Two Needles with large Eyes: the <em>raw</em> Silk put
      through, and tyed on a Knot at the Ends to prevent the Needles from
      being lost: to be ready at the Instant wanted, to sew up any Holes
      within Reach, in the Balloon; the Holes being first tyed up with
      Twine.</p>

    <p>The Needles to be stuck into Parchment, containing a small Hank of
      <em>raw</em> Silk: the Needle Silk run round the Parchment, to keep
      the Hank dry.</p>

    <p>The whole Hank to be tyed by one End to the Side of the Car; when
      above all Clouds, to shew, by the Divergency of the Threads, the
      Electricity of the Air.</p>

    <p>12. 12. A few Yards of Dutch Twine, loose in the Pocket, to tye the
      Neck of the Balloon in descending.</p>

    <p>12. 13. For easy Experiments; 1st, Dutch Twine, half a Mile long,
      on a Reel, or Pulley, or two Lengths on different Reels: also
      to each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>Reel a Flag, made of white Linen, a Yard square; and
      stretched by a slender Lath; one Side of the Flag being bound and
      stitched round it: also a Piece of Twine, two Yards long, is to be
      fastened by its Ends to the Ends of the Lath: a Loop is to be made
      in the Middle of the Twine: and to the Loop is to be applied round
      the Middle of the Lath another Piece of Twine, which will prevent
      the Lath from being bent; and will keep the Flag always stretched.</p>

    <p>By this Apparatus, Observers from below may be enabled to estimate
      the Height of the Balloon, as will be shewn in its proper Place.</p>

    <p id="article_12_14">12. 14. 2dly, To try the Density of the Air, at different Heights,
      <em>above</em> the freezing Point with Water; <em>below</em> it, with
      Brandy.</p>

    <p>In a Basket take two Pint-bottles, one full of Water, the other
      of Brandy; and six or eight empty ones: also a small Metal
      Tunning-dish.</p>

    <p>Let one End of a String be tyed round the Neck of each Bottle: and
      the other End sealed to the Top of a large Cork much tapered, to
      enter the Mouth easily. Round each Neck, tye a Parchment Label,
      large enough to contain in abbreviated Characters the Number of
      the Bottle; Time of Observation, Heights of the Barometer and
      Thermometer, while on the Ground.</p>

    <p>When an Experiment is made in the Air; pour off a full Bottle into
      an empty one: put the Cork into the emptied Bottle, and mark again
      the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>Time, Barometer and Thermometer: which are to be compared
      with an Eudiometer below, to discover the Rarity and Purity of the
      Atmosphere.</p>

    <p>12. 15. A third white Linen Flag, made as above, and tyed to the
      upper Hoop of the Balloon, so as to hang in Sight, will give Notice
      of a Change in the Wind.</p>

    <p>12. 16. A Yard of thin Ribbon, two Inches broad, tyed to the lower
      Hoop, will mark the Rise and Fall Of the Balloon.</p>

    <p>(12. 17. A Magnet and Iron Filings in a thin Pewter Dish with a
      Cover; Also</p>

    <p>The Prism and large Telescope were left, as too heavy.) And the
      Sextant or Quadrant coud not be procured in Time. They woud, have
      been of little Use, as no Horizon of the round Earth was seen
      during the Excursion: and it is presumed, that the circular Horizon
      is seldom visible, when the Balloon is at any considerable Height;
      the Accumulation of Vapour between the Eye and Horizon preventing
      it: tho’ such Vapour remains invisible to Spectators from below.</p>

    <p>12. 18. Eight Bladders, each above half blown, and differently
      coloured for Ornament, tyed round the <em>upper</em> Part of the Car,
      Breast high when the Aironaut stands upright: in Case the Balloon
      fall into Water.</p>

  <h3>ADDRESSED TO AIRONAUTS.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">New Kind of Cable and Reel recommended.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_13">Section 13.</span> THE following Anchor and Cable, for greater Safety and some
    particular Uses, are recommended as an Improvement.</p>

  <p>A <em>strong</em> Iron double Grapple, moving on a Swivel, fastened to a
    <em>Rope</em>,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
    half a Mile, or better <em>a Mile</em> long: and, if not all; a Part of
    which at least, at the Distance and for the Length of ten Yards from
    the Grapple, shoud be of Silk, as a non Conductor: also other ten
    Yards, at its upper End, counting from the Reel or Pulley to which the
    Silk shoud be tyed.</p>

  <p>The Reel or Pulley being at least eighteen Inches in Diameter, and
    fixed vertically in the Center of the upper Hoop, seven Feet above the
    Bottom of the Car; by Means of three or four Iron Rods fastened in
    the Bottom of the Car, and meeting together above the Reel: the Rods
    so strong as to prevent the Shock which otherwise the Aironaut woud
    receive in alighting on the Ground.</p>

  <p>The Reel shoud have one, or two Iron Winches or Handles, one at each
    End of the Reel; with moveable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> Handles of Wood round them. The Reel
    may be furnished with sudden Checks; or gradual Clamps, as in a Mil, to
    retard the Velocity.</p>

  <h3>SIGNS TO BE OBSERVED, WHEN IN THE AIR.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">Cautions against two Extremes.</div>

  <p id="section_14">14. The two Extremes to be avoided are, too lofty an Ascent: and too
    precipitate a Fall.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">1st. Too lofty an Ascent.</div>

  <p>The former is to be apprehended when Balloon has swelled considerably,
    and strains as if ready to burst; from the Shape of an inverted Cone,
    or Children’s Top, changed to that of an oblate Spheroid, or Turnep.</p>

  <p>It is therefore necessary to look up at the Balloon from Time to Time:
    and either open the Mouth, or as it is sometimes called the Neck,
    <em>for an Instant</em>; or draw the Valve; which is done by pulling a
    Cord fixed at the Top of the Machine and running thro’ it to the Hand,
    till the Balloon only appears full without straining.</p>

  <p>These Operations are to be occasionally repeated during the
    <em>Ascent</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>If it is required to rise still higher; gradually throw out Ballast,
    and repeat the Operations.</p>

  <p>The proposed Quantity of Ballast being thrown out, the Balloon will
    have acquired its utmost Height, and become stationary, i.&nbsp;e. neither
    rise nor fall.</p>

  <p>The self Descent of the Balloon is only in Proportion, as the
    inflammable Air or Gass escapes thro’ imperceptible Holes in the Silk
    or Seams.</p>

  <h3>2dly. <em class="smcap">To prevent too precipitate a Fall</em>.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">2ndly. Caution against too precipitate a Fall.</div>

  <p id="section_15">15. 1st. Tye, or compress the Mouth of the Balloon, for a Moment; which
    must always be opened, on observing that the Balloon is again risen
    to so great a Height as to <em>strain</em>, or be distended as above
    mentioned.</p>

  <p>2d. In descending, throw out Ballast, when the Balloon is within a
    Quarter of a Mile of the Ground, but not before, i.&nbsp;e. at 26 Inches
    by the Barometer: and, if the Fall is precipitate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> not less than 25
    Pounds Averdupoise, Pound by Pound, or at once, if there should be
    Occasion.</p>

  <p>3d. In Case of Accident, as the Escape of Gass; or if the Balloon
    be not furnished with <em class="smcap">an Equatorial Hoop</em>; prepare to throw
    out all the Ballast at the above Height, but not before; as the more
    forcible the Fall,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the greater the <em>Resistance</em>
    from the Air: cut away Ends of Cords; tear off Ornaments: part with Shoes,
    Cloaths. All which must be made <em>loose</em> and <em>ready</em> to throw
    out, at the Moment the Balloon begins to descend. Before the Landing,
    particular Care must be taken, that the Weight of the Aironaut be
    sustained, by grasping the Hands round the <em class="smcap">opposite</em> Sides of
    the upper Hoop; so that the Feet may not touch the Bottom of the Car.
    The Knees shoud likewise be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> bent. Repeating the above, at each Rebound
    of the Balloon, if any; the Aironaut will alight in the gentlest
    Manner: and probably the Balloon may act as a Parashute or Umbrella,
    which <em>alone</em> will, at all Times, ensure an easy Descent.</p>

  <h3>SIGNS WHEREBY TO JUDGE WHETHER THE BALLOON IS RISING OR FALLING.</h3>

  <h4>SIGNS OF RISING.</h4>

  <div class="sidenote">Signs of Ascent or Descent.</div>

  <p id="section_16">16. 1. When the Aironaut perceives a Pressure upwards against the Soles
    of his Feet.</p>

  <p>2. When some Objects, on the Surface of the Earth immediately below,
    diminish, and others disappear.</p>

  <p>3. When an upper Cloud approaches or involves the Balloon.</p>

  <p>4. When a lower Cloud leaves the Balloon.</p>

  <p>5. When Rain Snow or Hail beat <em class="smcap">violently</em> against the Top of
    the Balloon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

  <p>6. When Feathers, Balloon-Flag, or Ribbon seem to be drawn forcibly
    downwards.</p>

  <p>7. When Objects on Earth, or among Clouds below the Balloon, rise and
    present themselves <em>beyond those</em>, which, the moment before, were
    thought most distant.</p>

  <p>8. When the Balloon appears broader and shorter; also fuller at the
    Bottom; being more distended than at the first Ascent.</p>

  <h4>SIGNS OF DESCENT.</h4>

  <div class="sidenote">Signs of Descent.</div>

  <p id="section_17">17. 1. When the Aironaut perceives the Bottom of the Car withdrawing
    itself from the Pressure against the Soles of his Feet.</p>

  <p>2. When Objects on Earth, and surrounding Prospects encrease in
    Magnitude and Number.</p>

  <p>3. When a lower Cloud approaches or involves the Balloon.</p>

  <p>4. When an upper Cloud leaves the Balloon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

  <p>5. When Weather beats against the Bottom of the Car or Balloon.</p>

  <p>6. When Feathers, Balloon-Flag, or Ribbon appear to be drawn upwards.</p>

  <p>7. When the most distant Objects <em>set</em>, and disappear.</p>

  <p>8. When the Balloon seems taller; and its lower Hemisphere less
    distended, tho’ continuing <em>tight</em>.</p>

  <h4>SIGNS OF PROGRESSIVE HORIZONTAL MOTION.</h4>

  <div class="sidenote">Signs of progressive Motion deceitful.</div>

  <p id="section_18">18. These are equivocal and deceitful.</p>

  <p>When the Aironaut has lost Sight of the Earth by intervening Clouds;
    the Balloon seems at Rest, and only the lower Clouds appear to move:
    whereas the contrary may be true, the Clouds may rest, and only the
    Balloon move.</p>

  <p>In this Case, Attention must be paid to the half Mile white Flag, whose
    Situation and Motion must be observed, with respect to the Balloon,
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>to the Earth before the Cloud intervened. If the Flag retains
    its Situation with Respect to the Balloon, it may be inferred that no
    Change in the Direction has happened: if its Situation alters, the
    Sun or Compass is to be observed: and an Estimate made of the new
    Current of Air by which the Balloon is affected: its Velocity, Sound,
    Temperature, &amp;c.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">To descend when lost.</div>

  <p id="section_19">19. But to acquire a Certainty of course, it will be proper to descend
    below the Cloud: or move by Compass, Map, and a Knowledge of the
    Country: or try the long Cable (<a href="#section_13">Section 13</a>.)</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Signs of Wind horizontal.</div>

  <p id="section_20">20. It is likewise necessary to know the <em>Signs of Wind</em>, or
    Currents of Air.</p>

  <h4>SIGNS OF NEW AND SUDDEN HORIZONTAL CURRENTS.</h4>

  <p>When the Feathers, Balloon-Flag, or Ribbon, compared with Sun or
    Compass, take a new and sudden horizontal Direction.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

  <p id="section_21">21. <em class="smcap">of currents from above</em>: properly named <em>Waves
    Torrents and Tide of Air</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Signs of depressing Torrents and Tide of Air.</div>

  <p>They are very frequent, and require to be guarded against: are
    sometimes or long Continuance, at other Times momentary: against the
    first throw out Ballast at the Height of a Quarter of a Mile, but not
    before, or <em>as hereafter directed</em>: when momentary, and above that
    Height, Nothing is to be apprehended: the Balloon will appear broader
    and recover its Form.</p>

  <h3>PREPARATIONS FOR ASCENT.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">Preparations for Ascent.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_22">Section 22.</span> BEFORE half past I, Mr. Lunardi had inflated his Balloon
    in the finest Manner; and having, with the most obliging and spirited
    Attention, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> such Preparations, and taken such Precautions, as
    he thought were necessary to ensure the Success of the Expedition; sent to
    inform Mr. Baldwin (who continued purposely absent, that he might not
    disturb or precipitate the Process; but that every Circumstance shoud
    be conducted with Deliberation and without Hurry) that all Things were
    ready for his Departure.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Public reminded of the Necessity of preserving order
    during the Inflation of Balloons.</div>

  <p id="section_23">23. And Mr. Baldwin takes this Opportunity of returning his best Thanks
    to his Friends and the Public, on the Day of Ascent, for keeping
    <em class="smcap">the small Circle clear</em>, by strictly adhering to the Words
    of the Advertisement, which declared, “that in order to prevent an
    interruption of the Process in the Inflation of the Balloon, no Persons
    <em>were</em> to be admitted <em class="smcap">within the circle</em>, except those
    Gentlemen who politely undertook <em class="smcap">in turn</em> to hold the Lines which detained the
    Balloon.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Lead Weights placed at first in the Car, to prevent any
    Fatigue in holding the Lines, and the Necessity of weighing, unless at
    the Time of Ascent, to determine the Power of Levity.</div>

  <p id="section_24">24. It may be proper to mention that Mr. Baldwin being resolved to
    prevent the disagreeable Circumstances of being <em>weighed</em> in the
    Presence of Thousand spectators, at a Time when it is uncertain whether
    the Balloon has <em>acquired</em> a sufficient Degree of Levity to raise
    his own Weight, together with the Instruments, Provisions, Ballast, and
    other Articles, all which are known or easily calculated; finding some
    Days before, his own Weight, and having calculated the rest as under&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>;
    he ordered his Servant, on the Day of the Excursion,
    to bring Lead Weights equal to the <em>Sum total</em>, with an overplus Weight of
    10lb. for Levity of Ascent, and place them <em>gradually</em> in the Car,
    attached for that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>Purpose to the Balloon, soon after the Inflation
    began. By which Means the Gentlemen who held the Cords were quite at
    Ease: nor was there Occasion to tye the Lines during the Inflation, to
    Posts fixed in the Circumference of the Circle; nor consequently to
    <em>cut them</em> afterwards.</p>

  <p>But it will be seen that Mr. Lunardi inflated the Balloon in a superior
    Manner.</p>

  <p id="section_25">25. All Things being thus prepared, Mr. Baldwin stepped into the Car:
    and finding, that, besides his own Weight, the Provisions, Articles,
    Ballast, &amp;c. the Balloon woud support an additional Weight, and
    <em>still</em> rise with superior Levity; Mr. Lunardi put in 12lb. of
    additional Ballast, and <em>guessed</em> the encreased Levity at 10lb.
    more.</p>

  <h3>ASCENT WITH 20lb. OF LEVITY.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">Ascent at 40M. past I, with 20lb. of levity.</div>

  <p class="drop-capa"><span class="pleft" id="section_28">Section 28.</span>AT 40 Minutes past I, the Balloon having a Levity which not
    less than 20 Pounds Weight woud counterpoise, Mr. Baldwin was liberated
    by the Hands of Mr. Lunardi, who suffered no one to approach the Car:
    and he ascended, amidst Acclamations mixed with Tears of Delight and
    Apprehension, the Misgivings of Humanity, and other usual Sensations
    of Surprize, which, in a brilliant and numerous Assembly, will long
    continue to accompany a Spectacle so novel interesting and awful, as
    that of seeing a Fellow Mortal separated in a Moment from the Earth,
    and rushing to the Skies.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Employments of the Aironaut.</div>

  <p id="section_29">29. The Balloon well inflated, tower’d aloft in an upright and
    perpendicular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> Direction, with a quick Motion, and an accelerated
    Velocity.</p>

  <p>The Aironaut having stood up, for a Minute or two, waving his Hat in
    the left, and saluting the Spectators with Mr. Lunardi’s coloured Flag
    in the right Hand; put on his Hat, and having fastened the Flag-Staff
    horizontally among the Lines of the Balloon, immediately betook himself
    to different Employments, before he woud indulge in looking over the
    Brink of the Car; lest the Novelty of the Prospect shoud call off his
    Attention from <em>Things of Moment</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Sensation of rising described.</div>

  <p id="section_30">30. The Force of Ascent was, from the first, plainly <em>palpable</em>:
    the Sensation being that of a strong Pressure from the Bottom of the
    Car, upwards against the Soles of the Feet.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Caution against the vitriolic Acid Liquor.</div>

  <p id="section_31">31. His first Point being to guard against a Deluge of acidulous
    Liquor, which, he was told, had fallen, to the Quantity of three
    Quarts, on the Head and Shoulders of a former Aironaut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> from the
    Trunk or Bottom of the Balloon, which ended in a wide circular Opening
    of eighteen Inches Diameter; he found that when the Weight either of
    himself, or of the Ballast, was not exactly in the Center of the Car;
    the Opening of the Balloon woud, without any Trouble, hang so as to
    lie on the Outside of the Car: but he did not perceive more than a few
    Drops issue from the Mouth: which happened a few Minutes after he arose.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Attitude, and farther Employments.</div>

  <p id="section_32">32. This Difficulty vanishing; he changed his erect into an inclined
    Posture between sitting and kneeling; sometimes with the right Knee
    near the Bottom and Center of the Car: and having both Hands quite
    free, the Balloon being subject to no <em>sensible Motion</em>; he
    reconnoitred all the Lines and Cords: coiled the Rope or Cable to which
    the Anchor or grappling Iron was fixed: tyed fast its proper End to
    the upper Hoop: observed and felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> superior Thickness of the
    Cord leading to the Valve: coiled it, in order that it might be free to act:
    placed the untyed Bag of Ballast near the Outside of the Car: also the
    tyed Bags at proper Distances to preserve the Equilibrium: unwrapped
    one of the white Flags, tyed it to the String on one of the Reels, and
    just threw it an Inch or two over the Side of the Car: then placed his
    Watch, <em>open</em> Knife, Scissars, Thermometer and Compass on his
    right Hand: the Barometer being swung above in Sight towards the left.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Change of Attitude, and Observation of the reddish Vapour.</div>

  <p id="section_33">33. He then stood on his Feet, with a Design to look down: but his
    Attention was drawn to the Opening of the Balloon, which began to
    breathe out by Intervals a visible <em>reddish Vapour</em>; in Form like
    that which is seen at the Top of a Brewery, only that the under Surface
    was not jagged but smooth, altho’ wavy and uneven. The Particles which
    composed it were so large as to be distinctly visible: and appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
    as if endued with a very strong repelling Power, from the great and
    seemingly equal Distances, of about half a Quarter of an Inch, from
    each other.</p>

  <p>It was observed by a scientific Spectator from below, that the Parts
    of the Balloon, which reflected the Sun’s Rays, appeared of a bright
    Copper-Colour: but the <em>reddish</em> Vapour issuing from its Mouth put
    on the Form of a lambent Flame. A similar Appearance had been observed
    by him, in a former Ascent of the same Balloon, the Neck or Mouth being
    then likewise open; and also by others, who declared they saw the
    Balloon on Fire.</p>

  <p>The Change of the <em class="smcap">red</em> into Flame-Colour, when seen at a great
    Distance, may it not be owing to this, that the direct Rays, being
    mingled with those which are intercepted between the Eye and the
    Object, became in Part absorbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> and in Part refracted; and
    therefore
    coud not reach the Sight?</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Gass not offensive.</div>

  <p id="section_34">34. This gentle Evaporation of inflammable Air, or Gass, continued:
    disappearing at the Distance of four and five Inches below the Opening:
    nor did it offend the Smell; not descending within its Influence.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Attention to the Balloon, and Dimensions of the Car and Hoops.</div>

  <p id="section_35">35. He then looked upwards at the Balloon, and perceived that it was
    considerably swelled in its Dimensions: and that the Distention had
    raised the Bottom-Opening of the Balloon half way between the two
    Hoops: i.&nbsp;e. from his Hip to his Shoulder, as he stood upright. The
    Height from the Bottom of the Car (which was a thin circular Board four
    Feet and a half, Diameter, placed on a strong Netting, and covered with
    green Bays) to its Top or the lower Hoop, was three Feet; with the
    Netting continued round between the lower and upper Hoop.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Stationary, and Notes made.</div>

  <p id="section_36">36. He was aware that the Swelling of the Balloon, and copious Vapour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
    then issuing from it, denoted the Moment when it began to lose its
    ascensional or elevating Power; and that its accelerated Motion was
    diminishing.</p>

  <p>He therefore looked at his Barometer and Watch, which was 53 Minutes
    past I.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; took up his Pencil, and on a Card (marked
    before he left
    the Earth, as follows:</p>

  <p>Chester-Castle-Yard. Thursday, the 8th of Sept. 1785, I. o’Clock,
    Barometer 29&#x200B;8⁄10, Therm: 65 in the Shade towards the North;) he wrote
    “Rose at 40 Minutes past I.” He then looked again at the Barometer,
    which continued falling for some Minutes, and fluctuating up and down
    within the Space of an Inch or more. It first began to rest at 23&#x200B;1⁄4,
    and a little after at 23&#x200B;1⁄2. Having looked again at his Watch, he put
    down “57 Minutes past I. became stationary: Barometer 23&#x200B;1⁄4: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>Therm:
    still 65, sometimes lying in the Shade, and sometimes exposed to the
    Sun: the Balloon turning round frequently thro’ East to South.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Fluctuation of Barometer.</div>

  <p id="section_37">37. The Fluctuation of the Barometer, he imagined to arise from
    continued Exertions of the Gass within the Balloon, opposed by the
    atmospheric Air, which varying in Density and Temperature woud give an
    unequal Resistance to the Balloon: and both Gass and Air being elastic,
    the Power of Ascent would act by Intervals, and communicate its
    Pulsations to the Quicksilver in the Tube. His own irregular Motions in
    the Car would increase the Fluctuation.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Compass traversed, but was useless.</div>

  <p id="section_38">38. The Compass likewise traversed backwards and forwards, pointing due
    North, and unaffected by the Turns of the Balloon: but was useless, as
    the Sun shone bright the whole Time of the Excursion.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Aironaut first looked down at Leisure.</div>

  <p id="section_39">39. Thing’s taking a favourable Turn, he flood up, but with Knees a
    little bent, more easily to conform to accidental Motions, as Sailors
    when they walk the Deck: and took a full Gaze before, and below him.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Scenes below described.</div>

  <p>But what Scenes of Grandeur and Beauty!</p>

  <p>A Tear of pure Delight flashed in his Eye! of pure and exquisite
    Delight and Rapture; to look down on the unexpected Change already
    wrought in the Works of Art and Nature, contrasted to a Span by the
    <em class="smcap">new perspective</em>, diminished almost beyond the Bounds of
    Credibility.</p>

  <p>Yet so far were the Objects from losing their Beauty, that
    <em class="smcap">each</em> was <em class="smcap">brought up</em> in a new Manner to the Eye, and
    distinguished by a Strength of Colouring, a Neatness and Elegance of
    Boundary, above Description charming!</p>

  <p>The endless Variety of Objects, minute, distinct and separate, tho’
    apparently on the same Plain or Level, at once linking the Eye without
    a Change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> of its Position, astonished and enchanted. Their Beauty
    was unparalelled. The Imagination itself was more than gratified; <em>it was overwhelmed</em>.</p>

  <p>The gay Scene was Fairy-Land, and Chester Lilliput.</p>

  <p>He tried his Voice, and shouted for Joy. His Voice was unknown to
    himself, shrill and feeble.</p>

  <p>There was no Echo.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Let down the white Flag, 2 Furlongs, equal to half the
    Length of the Twine on one Reel.</div>

  <p id="section_40">40. He then returned to an Employment which, tho’ irksome, he imagined
    would contribute to the Amusement and Information of Spectators below,
    if it coud be completed while he continued in Sight;<span class="sidenote">Its Uses.</span> as it woud furnish
    them with Ideas of Height and Distance, altogether new and interesting,
    <em>as will be seen in their proper Place</em>: and unwound half the
    Reel; the white Flag hanging out to the Length of 440 Yards or a
    Quarter of a Mile.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Reel defective.</div>

  <p id="section_41">41. The circular Motion of the Balloon was communicated to the Loop
    in the Middle of one Side of the Lath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> or Reel, round which from End
    to End the Twine was wrapped, and by which it hung on his Finger, and
    pressed it to a Degree of Pain.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Employment again suspended.</div>

  <p>The Work was again suspended.</p>

  <p>He coud not long withstand the Temptation of indulging his Eye with a
    View of the glorious and enchanting Prospect.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Beautiful preferred to the Sublime, in Prospects.</div>

  <p id="section_42">42. But the Beautiful among the Objects below was still more attractive
    than the Sublime among those around.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Inverted Firmament what.</div>

  <p>On looking down South by West, the Balloon often turning gently to the
    right and left, and giving the Aironaut an Opportunity of enjoying the
    circular View without a Change of Attitude; innumerable Rays of Light
    darted on the Eye as it glanced along <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>the Ground: which, tho’ of a
    gay green Colour, appeared like an inverted Firmament glittering with Stars
    of the first Magnitude.</p>

  <p id="section_43">43. This splendid Appearance was owing to the Rays of the Sun reflected
    from certain Pits or Ponds of Water, of which there is one at least in
    most Fields or Inclosures throughout the County: but particularly in
    the low Grounds of Leach-Eye and Dodleston.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Broad Turnpike Road a narrow Foot Path.</div>

  <p>The Object that next drew his Attention, <em>while ascending</em>, was
    the Overley Turnpike-Road, which is remarkably wide, (resembling the
    Emilian Way across the Atrian Fens, between Bononia and Ferràra in

    composed of Sea-Sand cast up above high Water Mark. This appeared like
    a narrow Foot-Path well trodden, of a <em>white</em> Colour, and strait
    as if drawn by a Line.</p>

  <p id="section_44">44. Nothing however raised his Curiosity more than the Change in Colour
    of the River <em>Dee</em>, Avon ddû, (i.&nbsp;e. <em>Thee</em>) which in the
    British Language signifies the <em>black River</em>, from the Appearance
    of its Waters, when seen from an Eminence running in their deep Channel
    between the Mountains of Wales; but which glides by Chester with a
    Silver Stream. This River,—Thanks to the cool Climate; not like the
    <em>green</em> Mincius of Virgil!—had now acquired the unvaried Colour of
    <em>red Lead</em>. Nor coud he discover even the Appearance of Water; but
    merely that of a <em>broad red</em> Line, twining in Meanders infinitely
    more serpentine than are expressed in Maps.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Cause of the Change conjectured.</div>

  <p>Whether the Change arose from the Transparency of its Waters, when
    seen at the Height which was <em>apparently</em> 7 Miles, <em>as will be
    noticed hereafter</em>, though the Barometer made it scarcely a Mile
    and Half, is uncertain. He was at first inclined to think, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> the
    Rays, having suffered a double Refraction, were reflected to the Eye,
    from the reddish Sand which forms their Bottom, tho’, at the Depth of 7
    Yards at an Average, above the Cause-Way, or <em>artificial</em> Cascade
    near Chester Bridge: or possibly the Water of Rivers when seen at a
    certain Distance, may act as Water composing Clouds when view’d from
    below, at a certain Height and Angle; reflecting only the <em>red</em>
    Rays: the rest being refracted, or absorbed.</p>

  <p>The Colours of Objects shone more brilliant and lively at that amazing
    Height, than if seen on a Level with themselves.</p>

  <p>Nor did the Eye seem to want the Aid of Glasses: as every Thing, that
    coud be seen at all, was seen distinct.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The City of Chester <em>blue</em>.</div>

  <p id="section_45">45.The <em>Redness</em> of the River Dee was curiously contrasted by a

    Chester, when seen directly from above, on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> Scale not larger than
    the Plan of it, in Burdett’s Map.</p>

  <p>The Town was entirely <em>blue</em>.</p>

  <p>The highest Buildings had no apparent Height: their Summits were
    reduced to the common Level of the Ground. Nor was the Cathedral
    distinguished; nor any Tower or Spire discerned.</p>

  <p>The Whole had a beautiful and rich Look; not like a Model, but a
    coloured Map.</p>

  <p>The Roofs of all the Houses appeared, as if covered with <em>Lead</em>,

    it woud be improper not to mention a Circumstance which happened on the

    <em>alarming Apprehensions</em> for the Safety of the Aironaut, on seeing
    the Balloon move gently towards the Sea.</p>

  <p>They were however, in a great Measure, soon relieved from their
    Anxiety: for, by rising into another Current, he escaped the Danger:
    skirting the Coasts of the River Mersey; which coud not be seen from
    the Balloon at the Distance of little more than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> League, tho’ the
    Sun was supposed to shine the whole Time on the Water.</p>

  <p>The upper Current was, in Fact, rendered visible to the aërial
    Traveller, for more than two Hours before, and at the Time of his
    Ascent; by lofty Clouds of the second Stratum, flying in a safe Direction.</p>

    <em>apparently</em> many Miles above all visible Vapour, far beyond the
    Sight of every living Creature, and where the human Voice was no longer
    heard from below; the larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> Objects, with which the Surface of the
    distant Earth was covered, as Rivers Woods Inclosures, diminishing to
    the View, yet encreasing in their Beauty;—coud not but make a lively
    Impression on the Mind of the Aironaut.</p>

  <p>The striking Contrast and Novelty of his Situation filled him with
    unusual and pleasing Sensations.</p>

  <p>He had just left, for the first Time, his native Earth, where he had
    continued for a while the central Object to some <em>thousand</em>
    Spectators; whose Eyes, he knew, were still turned towards him; that he
    was still the Subject of their Conversation: yet no human Figure met
    his Sight; no human Sound vibrated on his Ear.</p>

  <p>An universal Silence reigned! an empyrèan Calm! unknown to Mortals
    <em>upon Earth</em>.</p>

  <p>The Sky was painted with a purer, and more transparent Azure. The Sun
    shone hot, and with a brighter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> Lustre. His Beams were <em>white</em>
    and sparkling: not surrounded with Haze or Vapour: but too fierce for the
    human Eye to look upon a second Time with Pleasure.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Objects which filled the Mind of the Aironaut with Wonder
    and Delight.</div>

  <p id="section_48">48. A Chearful Serenity filled the Breast of the Aironaut.</p>

  <p>In an erect Posture, and with the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>utmost Composure he gazed
    around: reflecting with Wonder and Delight on a Situation, where the
    <em class="smcap">Beautiful</em> and <em class="smcap">Sublime</em> were seen united, in a Manner
    perfectly novel and engaging.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Novel situation illustrated by a familiar Comparison.</div>

  <p>If it be allowed, for the Sake of Illustration, to compare <em>great</em>
    Things with <em>small</em>; he found himself suspended in the central
    Concave of an unmeasurable Crater Bowl or Bason; and considerably
    above the Rim or Margin, so as to peep fairly over it: for by looking
    <em>straight before him</em>, while the Balloon continued gently turning
    on its vertical Axis, he coud see quite round into the <em class="smcap">Blue</em>.</p>

  <p>The Earth was the <em>Miniature-Picture</em>&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> painted
    on the Bottom of the Bowl, on the Inside. The Sides of the Bowl next the Bottom
    were rather obscure: as the Objects, on the Surface of the Earth not
    immediately under the Eye, being foreshortened, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>were indistinct,
    either on Account of their immense Distance, or by mere Accumulation of
    Vapours, and mixed with Haze and Cloudiness.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Comparison carried on.</div>

  <p>From thence to the Top of the Bowl, was fantastically grouped, spotted,
    and dash’d with Clouds dense and luminous, in the strangest and most

    extended: The Rim or Margin ending, not in a fringed Border; but in a
    plain smooth Line; to represent the amazing Distance, at which, the
    upper Surfaces of <em>Clouds in Perspective</em> lost all their rugged
    mountainous and fringed Shapes; and terminated even and smooth: making
    a perfect horizontal Ring in the Heavens, somewhat below the Eye of

    alone be distinguished, that lay immediately below the Eye: the more
    remote becoming dim and faint. The whole would put on the Form of a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_51">Section 51.</span> THE Perspective of the Clouds was entirely new; and
    remarkable both for Beauty and Grandeur.</p>

  <p>The lowest Bed of Vapour that <em>first</em> put on the Appearance of
    Cloud was of <em>a pure white</em>; in detached Fleeces; encreasing as
    they rose. They presently coalesced, and were aggrandized into
    <em class="smcap">a Sea</em> <em>of Cotton</em>, but more <em>white</em>; and <em>dazling</em>:
    tufted here and there by the light Play of Air, and gentle Breezes in
    every Direction: but where undisturbed, the Whole became an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
    extended Firmament or <em>white</em> Floor of thin Cloud, thro’ whose Intervals
    the Sun must shine with fiercer Gleam. The upper Surface was quite
    even: not blended with the Air above, but defined and separated with
    the utmost Exactness; being condensed by the Coolness, and checked in
    their Ascent, by the Levity of the superior Regions.</p>

  <p>Thro’ this <em>white</em> Floor uprose in splendid Majesty and awful
    Grandeur, at great and unequal Distances, a vast Assemblage of
    <em>Thunder-Clouds</em>: each Congeries consisting of whole Acres in the
    densest Form.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Circular Boundary of the <em>celestial</em> Prospect from the

  <p id="section_52">52. Their conglomerate and fringed Tops rising, at different Distances,

  <p>Their Form was, as if Pieces of Ordnance were discharged
    perpendicularly upwards into the Air: and that the Smoke had
    consolidated, at the Instant of Explosion, into Masses of Snow or Hail:
    had penetrated thro’ the upper Surface or <em>white</em> Floor of common
    Clouds, and there remained visible, and at Rest.</p>

  <p>Some indeed had not wholly lost their Motion: continuing still to
    be lifted up. Others ponderous and sleepy, nodded, by mere Weight,
    their monstrous Heads. It seemed as if they had persisted in mounting
    upwards, till they coud rise no higher: their lower Parts pressing
    perpendicularly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>against the upper, which gradually swelled them out
    on <em>all Sides</em>. By partial and temporary Movements of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>the Air,
    some broad <em>unwieldy</em> Caps lost the <em>vertical</em> Direction of their
    Columns. The Columns likewise underwent a similar and gradual Change:
    rolling from their Pedestals or spiral Bases; and, at Times, assuming
    <em class="smcap">every organized Shape</em> that Fancy coud suggest.</p>

    as well as of the ancient Philosophers, that AIR GIVES FORM TO THINGS:

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon Shadow traced on the Clouds.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_56">Section 56.</span> DURING the Time that the Balloon from being stationary
    at 23&#x200B;1⁄4 (corresponding to the Height of about a Mile and a half)
    began to <em>decline</em>, which it must have done with a brisk Motion,
    imperceptible to the Aironaut at the Time, tho’ since recognized, on
    Account of the great Opening at the Bottom; he traced its <em>Shadow</em>
    over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> the Tops of Volumes of Clouds below. It was at first small: in
    Size and Shape like an Egg: but soon encreased to the Magnitude of
    the Sun’s Disk; and woud have made a solar Eclipse to a Spectator
    looking from the Cloud: still growing larger, as the Balloon descended,
    or Clouds arose. But his Attention was presently called to another
    equally novel, but more captivating Appearance; that of an <em>Iris</em>
    encircling the whole <em>Shadow</em>, at some Distance round it. The
    Colours were remarkably brilliant.</p>

  <p>This <em>celestial Phantom</em> attended the Aironaut for a few Minutes:
    conforming, as a Vessel at Sea, to the Change of <em>Surface</em>;
    now plainly visible, now indistinct and disappearing; as it passed
    <em>throu’</em> the <em>luminous</em> or <em>shadowy Wave</em> of Clouds
    <em>apparently</em> at Rest.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Iris, a Frame to the pictured Land, vanishes.</div>

  <p id="section_57">57. The Clouds, in which this Phenomenon continued, were of the
    superior or second Stratum in Height, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> fair Weather; rare; of
    a transparent <em>Blue</em> and purest <em>White</em>, alternate. At the
    End of four Minutes they dispersed, so as to admit an unexpected Sight
    of the pictured Land thro’ <em class="smcap">them</em>, and thro’ the Place of
    <em>the Balloon-Shadow</em>; whose Form first vanishing, <em>the Iris</em>
    remained, for a few Seconds, complete, and in resplendent Beauty.</p>

  <p id="section_58">58. <em>Írides</em>, of the same Kind, tho’ of less vivid Colours, are
    seen round the Moon, in a mild Evening; as thin light Clouds move

  <div class="sidenote">Sun hottest when the Balloon was stationary.</div>

  <p id="section_59">59. The Sun shone brighter and fiercer, when the Balloon was at its

    were of a <em>dark</em> Colour;) while the Aironaut <em>stood</em> with his
    Face from the Light.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Lunardi’s Flag thrown out, at the Height of a Mile.</div>

  <p>The Mouth remaining open, it continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> to descend, as appeared by
    the Barometer which had risen nearly to 24 Inches: at which Instant Mr.
    Lunardi’s <em>coloured</em> Flag was thrown out, for the Information of
    a Friend; and that Spectators below might judge what was nearly the
    perpendicular Height of a Mile in the Air, according to Halley’s Table.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Flag was seen to descend for 3 Minutes.</div>

  <p id="section_60">60. The Flag was seen by the Aironaut descend for three Minutes: at
    which Time it became invisible. It fell, <em>not</em> perpendicularly;
    but in large Spirals, and by Jerks; darting first on one Side, then on
    the other. The Resistance of the Air made it act as a Parashute. The
    Flag was instantly pursued, and taken up in a Field one Mile distant
    from Chester. The Descent of the Balloon must have been retarded, being
    four Pounds and a half lighter.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Dove turned out.</div>

  <p id="section_61">61. The Pigeon was then taken out of the Basket of Matting: Thermometer
    54; Barometer 25&#x2060;3⁄10. It trembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> much. Being turned loose, it
    looked frequently up at the Car; but flew downwards in cylindrical Gyrations
    eight or ten Yards in Diameter, according to the Turn of its Head to
    the right, which seemed to rest in an oblique Attitude: the Wings and
    Tail continuing extended as much as possible, but without Motion,
    during its Descent. The Bird was out of Sight in a few Minutes: but
    continued, as <em>the Owner</em> observed, full half an Hour, in the Air.</p>

  <p>For the same Cannon, discharged the third Time at the Distance of 30

  <p>Before the Weight became invisible; it <em>appeared</em> to move a good

  <p id="section_69">69. It is somewhat remarkable, that, on repeated Enquiries from
    unprejudiced Persons, the <em>white</em> Flag, when suspended from the
    Car above 440 Yards, appeared 4 Yards long: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> when at the end of
    the <em>half Mile</em> Twine, seemed about 8 Yards long, to Spectators
    from below, in different Places: that sometimes it appeared before,
    and sometimes behind the Balloon: while to the Observer in the Car,
    it seemed regularly to follow the Balloon: unless when a <em>new</em>
    Motion was impressed upon the latter: at which Time the <em>white</em>
    Flag was situated almost under the Car: or when the Balloon changed its
    Direction; the Flag being <em>then</em> not always <em>discoverable</em>.</p>

  <p>When seen <em>edgewise</em> or <em>foreshortened</em>; it woud
    <em>appear</em> to be <em>nearer</em> the Car than it really was.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Effect of the <em>white</em> Flag on the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_70">70. As there was a Peculiarity attending the Situation of the <em>half
    Mile</em> Flag, which may prove of singular Use in Airostation; it ought
    not to be passed over in Silence.</p>

  <p>The half Mile Flag hanging loosely from the Car; not perpendicularly
    under, but following it, frequently at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> an Angle of about 45
    Degrees; shews that the Flag met a Resistance from the Air, unfelt by the
    Balloon: which out strip’d it, in Proportion to the <em>greater</em>
    Surface which the Balloon exposed to the Wind.</p>

  <p>Taking also into the Account, that the Balloon remained in Equilibrio;
    while the Flag was subject to the Force of Gravity: which Force was
    restrained from Exertion, otherwise than as a <em>Vis Inertiæ</em>, to
    keep it always in a perpendicular Situation.</p>

  <p>The Resistance of the Air, acting in an horizontal Direction against
    the <em>Vis Inertiæ</em> of the Flag, must have a Tendency to drive it
    back: which being ineffectual; the Flag must consequently <em>rise</em>;
    and in rising <em>will retard the Balloon</em>.</p>

  <p>A Power may therefore be communicated to a Balloon, in the Direction
    of the Wind, which shall <em>retard</em> its Progress throu’ the Air: a
    Subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> which seems capable of farther Prosecution.</p>

    <p id="section_74">74. One of the Pint-Bottles for light Air was prepared (as in <a href="#article_12_14">Article 14</a>,
     of Section 12;)<span class="sidenote">Bottle filled with <em>light</em> Air.</span> and dropped from the Car.</p>

  <p>The <em>Water</em> it contained was poured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> down, to observe the
    Effects
    of <em>Air</em> and <em>Light</em> on the Drops.</p>

  <p>The Air did <em>not</em> at that Height oppose a Resistance sufficient
    to break the Stream into <em>small</em> Drops. Nor did they seem to
    coalesce: remaining, while they continued in Sight, of the same Size;
    some very large, others less so; and at the same <em>relative</em>
    Distance, as when they first left the Bottle.</p>

  <p>The Colours seemed <em>stronger</em> than usual.</p>

  <p>It may be <em>here</em> observed that none of the Bottles were returned;
    tho’ found, and a Reward promised.</p>

  <p>The Country People, as soon as they saw a Bottle; imagining it must
    contain some Liquor, immediately contrived to open it: by which
    Procedure, the Intention of the Experiment was frustrated.</p>

  <p>The Bottles, which are <em>dangerous</em> Companions even without
    Liquor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> shoud, notwithstanding, be left in the Car: at least till
    the Time of <em>landing</em> the Balloon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Burton and Flint seen at the <em>first</em> rising.</div>

  <p id="section_75">75. While the Balloon was <em>first</em> rising; a gentle Motion of the
    lower Current of Air carried it immediately towards the Sea. (<a href="#section_46">Section 46</a>.)</p>

  <p>At which Time, the Aironaut by a <em>Glance</em> discovered the Mouth of
    the River Dee, four and five Miles wide, <em>yawning before him</em>:
    the Prospect extending to the Sea, as far as the <em>Smoke</em> from
    the Lead-Works near a Place called Flint on the Welch Coast; and to
    Burton-Head on the Wirral Side; distant ten Miles from Chester.</p>

  <p>He has since been informed; that the Balloon seemed to <em class="smcap">rest</em>,
    for a few Minutes, in the Air: and then <em>return slowly</em> over
    Chester.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon in a <em>quiescent</em> Bed of Air.</div>

  <p>It is therefore more than probable, that as the Balloon continued to
    ascend; it was <em>becalmed</em> in a <em>quiescent Stratum</em> or Bed
    of the Atmosphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> which existed for a certain Depth or Thickness,
    between the lower and upper Current: and that the Direction of the
    Balloon was changed; the Instant it arrived within the Influence of the

  <div class="sidenote">Of <em>rowing</em> the Balloon to any Point of the Compass.</div>

  <p>Consequently, with a proper Apparatus to ascend and descend <em>at

    remained suspended <em>invariably</em> at the same Height, and
    <em>vertically</em> over the same Spot of Earth: or, with propulsive
    Machinery; might, on the same Level, have been <em>rowed</em> to any
    Point of the Compass.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Balloon, influenced on its Approach towards

  </div>

  <p id="section_76">76. In passing <em>only</em> <em class="smcap">across</em> Trafford Meadows, three
    Miles from Chester; the Balloon lost its usual progressive Motion over
    the Country: for more than a Quarter of an Hour, following the Course
    of the River Goway to the West North-West, and towards the Sea, as at
    Chester: turning gently backwards and forwards round its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> Axis,
    near the Villages of Great and Little Barrow: and making Curves over
    the Meadows, whose Breadth at those Places was about a Mile.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Its Progress marked.</div>

  <p>The Balloon then returned into its former Direction: inclining,
    <em>again</em>, towards a Brook and Meadow near Alvanley: passed Eastward
    a little to the left of Manley (<em>white</em>) Mill: crossed the Forest
    of Delamere, and Crag of Helsbye, (about twice the Height of Shooter’s
    Hill, near London;) whose lofty Summit was <em>apparently</em> reduced to
    a common Level with the Valley made by the River Wever, and with the
    adjacent Sea Marsh. Nor coud it have been distinguished by a Stranger,
    as an <em>Eminence</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Hills and Vallies on a Level.</div>

  <p>Indeed, the Wood near Kingsley, which grows on a sloping Ground,
    skirting the Hill, and <em>from</em> the Sun, put on a <em>dusky</em>
    Hue; and the Tops of the Trees a <em>darker Green</em>: this Difference
    of <em>Colour</em>, conveyed the <em>faint Resemblance</em> of a rising

    proceeding in its usual Course over the Country in the <em>upper</em>

    <em class="smcap">across</em> the Meadows to the Wever; was actually stopped; and
    being <em>entangled</em> by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> the <em>River</em>, evidently changed its
    former Direction: imitating, if possible, <em>its</em> Meanders; or
    at least making Gyrations in Circles of different Diameters, at the
    same Time turning different Ways round its Axis: describing Curves,
    something similar to that of the Moon round the Earth in her Orbit; or
    of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, as those <em>Curves</em> are delineated
    in the <em>Prints</em> of Long’s Astronomy:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the
    Course of the River being its <em>changeable</em> Center.</p>

  <p id="section_79">79. It is to be observed, that if the Balloon had continued to pursue
    its <em>former</em> Course; no Danger was to be apprehended of its
    falling on the Sea, or on the broad Branch of the River Mersey towards
    Warrington.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, it must have gone into the Heart of the adjoining
    County, and passed near Manchester.</p>

  <p>It is likewise worthy of remark; that unless a Fragment of light
    Vapour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> intervened for a few Seconds; the Country immediately below
    the Observer was <em>continually</em> illuminated by the Sun’s Rays: tho’
    none but the larger Objects were distinguishable at the Bottom of the
    profound Abyss, <em>more</em> than two Miles in Diameter at one View:
    that being the utmost Boundary of the circular Prospect below.</p>

    its Waves<span class="sidenote">Circularity of Prospect below, bounded by <em>Vapour</em>.</span> upon the Shore, which were plainly heard, was totally
    eclipsed: as if by Haze or Vapour, which began to be accumulated only
    at a certain Height <em>below</em> the Balloon; yet in such a Manner
    as <em>not</em> to prevent the solar Rays from penetrating throu’, and
    shining bright upon the Water.</p>

  <p id="section_81">81. There was now sufficient Leisure to trace the incredible Variety of
    most beautiful <em>Curves</em>, into which the Stream had worked the Bed
    of the River Wever in a Course of <em>Time</em>, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> Compass
    of a few Miles: an Appearance which <em>demonstrates</em> the Incorrectness of
    <em class="smcap">Maps</em>.</p>

  <p>Some <em>actual</em> Clouds presented themselves in detached Groupes over
    the Land: and the <em>Land</em> itself <em>shone</em> plainer throu’ the

  <p id="section_82">82. On reconnoitring the scattered Town of Frodsham, which like
    Chester was of a <em>light</em> <em class="smcap">Blue</em>; the Balloon moving <em>by

    the Plan of which was small, neat, but of a <em>darker Blue</em>,

    <em>below</em> him.</p>

  <p id="section_84">84. He had Time however to make the following Remarks. Cattle, if
    grazing in the Meadows, were not distinguishable; or at least were
    not distinguished. It was in vain to look for Sheaves of Corn, or
    Hattocks on the Ground: possibly from a Sameness of <em>Colour</em> like
    the growing <em>Stalks</em>, and <em>Field</em>: or <em>protruding</em>
    but a small Degree of <em class="smcap">Elevation</em>; tho’ the <em>Shadow</em>

    By throwing out Ballast, the Balloon woud instantly rise: but it
    woud probably, as <em>before</em>, rise into <em class="smcap">a Calm</em>, and
    therefore <em>descend</em> nearly in the same Line: which woud merely
    <em>protract</em> the Time till the Balloon had reached the Center of the
    Channel: where, having no Resource, the Ballast being then expended;
    there might be some Risque in waiting for a Vessel, tho’ the Balloon
    woud not for <em class="smcap">several Hours</em>, have lost its <em>levitating</em>
    Power, so as to have sunk with the Aironaut. To him however it
    immediately occurred, that there might be an <em class="smcap">under</em> Current
    of Air, as usual in the Middle of the Day, blowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> from Sea to
    Land: and, that if the Balloon was made to descend <em class="smcap">quickly</em> into
    the Sea-Breeze; it might, in a few Minutes, be carried so <em>far</em>
    within the Country, as to be <em>soon beyond</em> the Influence of the
    <em>Sea</em> and <em>River</em>: and <em class="smcap">then</em>, by throwing out some
    Pounds of Ballast, woud return into the <em>upper</em> Current, and
    pursue a <em>safe</em> Course towards Manchester; or even towards Prescot
    and Liverpool, if an easterly Wind prevailed <em>above</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_88">88. In Consequence of these Expectations; he looked downwards
    <em>towards</em> the Sea, <em>then</em> wholly <em>invisible</em>; tho’ the
    Murmuring of its Waves was <em>more</em> plainly heard.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Smoke blown to Land by a Sea-Breeze.</div>

  <p><em class="smcap">Thick Smokes</em> were distinguished issuing from <em>different</em>

    the Ground, as if impelled by a <em>brisk</em> Wind from the Sea.</p>

  <p id="section_89">89. No Time was to be lost.</p>

  <p>The Balloon having reached the Cascade; and continuing to move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
    more
    regularly along the Course of the River, past the <em>Bridge</em>, and
    proceeded to <em>Rock-Savage</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Balloon still going to Sea, the Mouth was opened.</div>

  <p id="section_90">90. The Neck or <em>Mouth</em> which remained shut, by its own Pressure

    instantly brought within the Hoop, and set <em class="smcap">wide open</em> in a
    perpendicular Situation.</p>

  <p>Not more than a Couple of Minutes had elapsed before Sounds were more

    approached the Earth; found that the Balloon was <em>influenced</em>
    by an <em class="smcap">under</em> Current blowing from the Sea: and marked his
    Progress by the half Mile <em class="smcap">white</em> Flag; whose Stretcher having
    acquired a Position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> parallel to the Plane of the Horizon, placed

  <p>No <em>visible</em> Clouds were presented <em>near</em> the Spectator. On
    the contrary, they seemed to <em>shrink back</em> to the Distance of a
    Mile round the Eye; and then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span><em>immediately</em> appear above it,
    the Balloon continuing to descend. Nor did any <em>circular</em> Horizon of
    the Earth shew itself; till the Balloon had reached below this Level:
    viz. Barom. 26&#x200B;1⁄2, Thermom. 55. i.&nbsp;e. Temperate.</p>

  <p>Prospects were most <em class="smcap">extensive</em> and beautiful at this Altitude:
    which the Barometer estimates at full half a Mile.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

  <p>Looking again at the Barometer, scarce a Minute afterwards; it had
    risen to 27.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Sudden Effect of cool moist Air on the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_94">94. The Condensation by Chill and Moisture, and quick Contraction of
    <em>its</em> Dimensions acted like a <em>Charm</em> on the <em>Balloon</em>.</p>

  <p>In a Moment; as if dropped from the Clouds, the <em class="smcap">Sea</em> suddenly
    presented itself.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It seemed <span

    filled the Eye.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

  <p>Almost the whole Extent of the Channel was a perfect Calm: and rather
    <em>dazled</em> the Sight. But from the Peninsula of Hale to that of
    Runcorn, and upwards, a <em>partial</em> <em class="smcap">Breeze</em> from the
    North-West <em>ruffled</em> the Surface (which was there of a <em>dark</em>
    and menacing Complexion;) and seemed in its Course to have reached
    and <em>influenced</em> the Balloon: whose Descent proving <em>more</em>
    rapid than was expected; the Sand-Bag tyed up, weighing 12 Pounds, was
    opened, and the Sand <em>dispersed</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Ballast thrown down, 12lb. and 12lb.</div>

  <p id="section_95">95. The Aironaut continuing as before to <em>stand</em> upright in the
    Car, and having resumed his Card and Pencil; Thermometer <em>again</em>
    at 55°, on finding the Descent not <em>sufficiently</em> retarded,
    wrote swiftly, “<span class="smcap">no more remarks, mind the ship</span>:” meaning the
    Balloon: and briskly stooping for the second Bag of Sand, weighing
    likewise 12 Pounds, <em>dispersed</em> it by <em>Handfulls</em> in the same
    Manner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Descent at first rapid.</div>

  <p id="section_96">96. The circular Mouth of the Balloon continuing wide open, at about
    18 Inches Diameter; so much <em>cool</em> and <em>moist</em> Air rushed
    in during the Descent; that, tho’ its Momentum or acquired Motion was
    retarded by <em>Dispersion</em> of the Ballast, it had not yet recovered
    an <em class="smcap">actual levity</em>: being too near the Ground before the second
    Bag was discharged.</p>

  <p><em>Presuming</em> however that 24 Pounds Weight of Ballast thrown
    out, was sufficient to break the Fall, tho’ in a cool moist
    <em>condensing</em> Atmosphere of <em>pure defloguisticated</em> Air; the

  <div class="sidenote">A <em>depressing</em> Torrent of Air on the Balloon.</div>

  <p>It has been <em>since</em> imagined that a <em>heavy</em>

  <p>As two credible Farmers were working, with their Servants, in the

    they took to be a <em>Whirl-wind</em>, or <em>distant Thunder</em>, and
    which seemed every Moment to encrease and approach them; they all
    retreated under a large Oak. While there, they first perceived the
    swift Descent of the Balloon. Two, who were afraid of Thunder, then
    began to take Courage, boldly exclaiming they shoud never fear Thunder
    again, since the <em>Falling</em> of a Balloon coud be attended with so
    <em>terrible</em> a Noise.</p>

  <h3>BALLOON STILL DESCENDING.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_98">Section 98.</span> THE Car, gliding <em>over</em> Trees in the <em>farther</em>
    Hedge-Row of a Grass Field, glanced on the Ground.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Caution on Landing.</div>

  <p>The Aironaut, being <em>prepared</em> for the Event, supported a
    <em>Part</em> of the Weight of his Body by his Hands, grasping the
    <em>upper</em> Hoop.</p>

  <p>The Balloon <em>stooping</em>, and declining from the North-West Breeze,
    drew the <em>upper</em> Hoop out of the Perpendicular: by which Means,
    the Bottom of that Division of the Barometer-Frame which contained the
    <em>Tube</em>, pressed against the Bottom of the Car on the Ground, was
    <em>separated</em> from the remaining Half of the Frame, and fell on the
    <em>Grass</em>.</p>

  <p>The Balloon, then rising with an elastic <em>Bound</em>, elevated the Car
    a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> Yards, and descended to the Ground, but <em>more</em> gently
    than before: rose again; and the Aironaut perceiving that the progressive
    Motion of the Breeze was bringing the Balloon near a <em>third</em>
    Hedge; took up his Knife, (which lay by him <em>ready open</em> for Use)
    and <em>cut away</em> the remaining Half of the <em>Barometer-Frame</em>;
    threw out the <em>Basket with the Bottles</em>,<span class="sidenote">More Ballast parted
    with, viz. seven Pounds.</span> and <em>Tunning Dish</em>;

  <p>The Car <em>cleared</em> the Hedge, and <em>slightly</em> for an
    <em>Instant</em> touched Ground, the <em>third</em> Time.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Farmers offering their Assistance.</div>

  <p id="section_99">99. During these Operations; the Aironaut had observed different
    Persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> in Motion towards him, who proved to be several
    <em>Farmers</em> and <em>Labourers</em> who had run themselves out of Breath to
    <em>overtake</em> the Balloon.</p>

  <p>One asked the Aironaut, whether he intended to alight; and was
    answered, “<em>Not for any Time</em>.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Proof of the <em>gentle</em> Descent.</div>

  <p id="section_100">100. The Car alighted each Time so <em>smoothly</em>, that neither the
    <em>Watch</em> nor <em>Thermometer</em> that lay near each other on the
    <em>green</em> Bays at the Bottom, were displaced. Nor was the <em>Glass
    Tube</em> containing the Quicksilver, separated from the Division of the

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon rapidly re-ascending.</div>

    id="Page_100">100</span> up like a Sky-Rocket, with accelerating

  <div class="sidenote">Drawing the Valve, while Mouth of the Balloon is
    <em>open</em>, shewn to be <em>dangerous</em>.
  </div>

  <p id="section_102">102. There being no proper Opportunity of closing the Mouth
    of the Balloon on its <em>near</em> Approach to the Sea, or
    during the <em>Swiftness</em> of its Descent; tho’ there had been
    <em>frequent Inclination</em> to attempt it; this <em>little</em> but
    <em class="smcap">essential</em> Work was instantly resolved upon. And the more
    so, as the Mouth had continued open <em>from</em> the first: and as
    Mr. Lunardi did not <em>happen</em> to mention this Circumstance: the
    Utility of which, tho’ <em>too late</em> to be put in Practice, had, but
    a few Minutes before, very plainly suggested itself. His Directions
    were, to <em>open</em> the Valve in order to descend: which woud
    <em>possibly</em> have <em>encreased</em> the Rapidity of Descent: and, by
    <em>introducing</em> a thorou’ Air <em>upwards</em>, while the Motion of
    the Balloon was in a <em>contrary</em> Direcion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> might have
    occasioned a <em>dangerous Rupture</em> of the lower Parts of the Balloon,
    <em>which</em> actually took Place in a preceding Excursion.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Balloon drawn <em>sideways</em>.</div>

  <p id="section_103">103. The Balloon, tho’ rising <em>quick</em>, seemed <em>not</em> to be
    wholly disengaged from the Ground, but to have received a Check; and
    to <em>lean</em> a little out of the Perpendicular: particularly the
    Car, which was evidently drawn a <em>different</em> Way <em>from</em> the
    Balloon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The half Mile <em>white</em> Flag impeding the Balloon.</div>

  <p>On perceiving that the half Mile <em>white</em> Flag, fastened to the
    <em>upper</em> Hoop of the Car, sensibly impeded the Elevation of the
    Machine, by <em>trailing</em> along the Ground, (the Balloon being yet
    within the Influence of the Sea-Breeze, or <em>lower</em> Current of
    Air;) the Question was, whether it woud not be imprudent to suffer the
    Balloon to rise near half a Mile, before the <em>white</em> Flag; was
    <em>disentangled</em> and free to follow it.</p>

  <p>For as neither the <em>Twine</em>, nor the <em>lower Cords</em> of
    the Balloon were of Silk; the Twine having lain on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> Trees or
    <em class="smcap">moist</em> Ground, might become a <em class="smcap">conductor</em> from the Earth
    to any Stratum of Air that had <em class="smcap">less</em> or <em class="smcap">more</em> than what
    is called its natural Quantity&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the <span
    class="smcap">electric</span> Fluid.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Twine <em>cut</em>, lest it shoud prove a <em>Conductor</em> of
    <em>Electricity</em>.</div>

  <p>Adding to the above, a Wish to rise higher the <em>second</em>
    Time than the first; stooping for the Scissars, the String was
    <em>cut</em>: reserving a Remainder to tye the Neck of the Balloon;
    which was immediately done by gathering the Parts of the Balloon
    into the Hand, wrapping a Couple of Yards loosely round, and tying
    them on a <em class="smcap">slip</em> or <em class="smcap">bow</em> Knot: one End of which was
    <em class="smcap">purposely</em> left hanging three Feet downwards, to <em>untye</em>
    instantly on Occasion.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Additional Levity of one Pound.</div>

  <p>This additional Levity of <em>nearly</em> one Pound, gave the whole
    Quantity of Ballast thrown over in a <em>few</em> Minutes, <em>nearly</em>
    32 Pounds.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Remarks on the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_104">104. The intelligent Farmer who stood near the Balloon, when it
    alighted at Bellair, had observed it for some Time <em>before</em> near
    the Sea, and marked <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>its Return, as coming <em>apparently</em> from
    <em>Overton</em>.</p>

  <p>At first, which was <em>more</em> than five Minutes before it came to the
    Ground, it seemed to him as if it coud not have been <em>larger</em> than
    a Bladder.</p>

  <p>He saw it reascend, first <em>sideways</em>, then upright; moving from
    the Sea.</p>

  <p>Afterward it rose <em>rapidly</em>, and rather <em>towards</em> the Sea and
    Warrington, distant twelve Miles.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><em>Apparent</em> Size of the Balloon, when seen from
    <em>below</em>.</div>

  <p>He watched it for a Quarter of an Hour: and caught it by Intervals,
    near and above a Cloud in the <em>blue</em> Sky, at so great a Height
    that it looked like a <em>Lark</em>: and at last: so <em>small</em> that
    the People who stood near him coud none of them regain a <em>Sight</em>,
    when they had once lost it.</p>

  <p id="section_105">105. The remaining <em>white</em> Flag was unfolded, and tyed to one
    of the Balloon-Cords attached to the <em>upper</em> Hoop, at a proper
    Distance to <em>play</em> freely in the Wind: and, notwithstanding all
    that has been said to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> contrary, shewed <em>instantaneously</em>
    and <em>plainly</em> the corresponding Changes made by the Wind in different
    Directions.</p>

  <p>And, as the Breeze was accompanied with a Sensation of <em>Coolness</em>
    against the Face of the Aironaut, looking towards that Quarter from
    whence the Wind came, as indicated by the Flag; (which Quarter was
    not in a Line with the Path of the Balloon;) the Flag must have shewn
    that the Change was made by the <em>Air</em> in <em>its peculiar</em>
    progressive Direction, and not by <em>its</em> Resistance or Progress in
    the Track of the Balloon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><em>Balloon</em> moving in a Direction <em>different</em> from
    that of the <em>Air</em>.</div>

  <p id="section_106">106. It is probable that the <em>Momentum</em> of the Balloon, acquired
    by its centrifugal or accelerating Force upwards, might have kept
    it in <em>one</em> Direction, while it continued to rise throu’
    <em>different</em> Currents.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_107">Section 107.</span> THE Balloon being now <em>wholly</em> unconfined,
    continued to <em>rise</em> with <em>great</em> Rapidity: crossed the
    Meadow in the Sea-Breeze, and remained as <em>before</em>, for 6 or 8
    Minutes,—by Intervals <em>gently</em> turning on its Axis—almost wholly
    <em>vertical</em> over Aston-Hall, but rather more to the <em>Eastward</em>
    of it.</p>

  <p>The Country still exhibited <em>bright gay</em> and <em class="smcap">extensive</em>

  <p id="section_108">108. <em>Three</em> Sail of <em>Vessels</em> appeared in the
    <em class="smcap">Channel</em>: and <em>four more</em> were sailing down the River
    Wever, <em>apparently</em> just under the Balloon, diminishing to <em>mere
    Cockle-Shells</em>, or like <em>Boats</em> which have <em>no</em> Rigging.</p>

  <p>Shouts continued.</p>

  <p>Corn and Cattle were visible in the Fields and Meadows.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

    <em>descending</em>, indicated by the Thermometer at 55°. (<a href="#section_92">Sect. 92</a>.)</p>

  <p>He then found himself inclined to taste the <em>Brandy and Water</em>,

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon <em>shrunk</em> to its usual <em>Shape</em>.</div>

  <p id="section_123">123. <em>Instant</em> Relief was given to the Balloon: which shrunk

    <em>lowering</em> itself to the Height of his Shoulders, as in Section 35.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Mouth <em>opened</em> at 41 Minutes past III.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">No <em>visible</em> Vapour escaped.</div>

  <p>Nor was he surprised that no <em>visible</em> Vapour escaped; as he

    woud <em>go out first</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Why the <em>Valve</em> at the Top is not to be <em>opened</em>.</div>

    had soared <em>above</em> the Sea-Breeze; as the Aironaut had expected to
    feel the extreme Rigour of Winter; and had made Preparations against
    <em>intense</em> Cold.</p>

  <p>Nor did he find any Difficulty in Respiration <em>during</em> the
    Excursion; which may possibly be accounted for from the <em>Warmth</em>
    of the Air.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Breath not visible during the Excursion.</div>

  <p>That the Breath&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> was <em>not</em> visible at
    <em>any</em> one Time, and
    particularly while <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>the Balloon was elevated above the
    <em>under</em> Current, might it not be owing to the uncommon <em class="smcap">dryness</em> of

    <em>Exposure</em>?</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Encreased Shadows seem to raise the Objects.</div>

  <p id="section_127">127. It was remarked, some little Time <em>before</em>, and <em>during</em>

    seemed <em>thicker</em> in Proportion to the <em>Plan</em>, than when

  <div class="sidenote">Prospects <em>below</em> noted.</div>

  <p id="section_128">128. The Circuit of the <em>Land-Abyss below</em> was also greatly

  <p>The Channel and <em>broad</em> Branch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> the River Mersey towards

  <p>The Lawn itself, which composed the Ground-View, was full of
    <em>innumerable</em> Enclosures <em>almost</em> <em class="smcap">close</em> to each

    of trying the upper Valve; <em>purposely</em> to know the Effect. So
    retaining the Bottom of the Balloon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> in his <em>right</em> Hand, he
    drew the Valve Cord with his <em>left</em>.</p>

  <p>Immediately he heard it <em>click</em>: which proved that it was quite

  <div class="sidenote">The Valve answered.</div>

  <p id="section_134">134. He tried the Valve three Times <em>smartly</em>, and deliberately.</p>

  <p>The Escape of the inflammable Air or Gass was like the <em>growling</em>

  <h3>USEFUL CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">Change in the <em>Form</em> of the Balloon while descending:
    with Conclusions drawn from the Change.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_159">Section 159.</span> IT was remarkable that, the lower Parts of the Balloon
    regularly adopted a <em>similar</em> Form at each Descent: not unlike
    a <em>Ship’s Bottom</em>; looking up, at the Head or Prow, while on
    the Stocks: the <em>Neck</em> of the Balloon forming a beautiful
    <em>central</em> Pillar; in Shape like that of a <em>Speaking Trumpet</em> inverted.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Time of Descent discovered by the Form of the Balloon.</div>

  <p>And hence may be derived a Piece of <em>useful</em> Information:
    as the <em>precise</em> Time of descending is discovered by bare
    <em>Inspection</em> of the Machine.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon adopting the Form of an elliptic Solid.</div>

  <p id="section_160">160. Another Conclusion seems likewise deducible from the above, that
    if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> the Balloon is so burdened, as to <em>descend</em> while it
    retains the Form of an <em class="smcap">elliptic solid</em>;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44"
    class="fnanchor">[44]</a> it will descend more
    rapidly, than if it contained less Gass: the Force of Descent in both
    Cases being supposed the same.</p>

  <p>For if the Diminution of Gass be so great as <em>not</em> to fill
    the upper Hemisphere of the <em>Balloon</em>; the Resistance of the
    atmospheric Air <em>below</em> woud probably give <em>it</em> the
    Appearance of a <em>Concave</em> or Umbrella, which woud greatly
    <em>check</em> the Descent: viz. in Proportion to the Square of the
    Number of Feet of which the Surface was composed.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">An equatorial Hoop prefered to a Parashute.</div>

  <p id="section_161">161. Hence also the evident Utility of an <em class="smcap">equatorial hoop</em>

  <p>A Sort of <em>hollow</em> Wind seemed issuing from a Plain of Clouds

  <div class="sidenote">An unusual Motion communicated to the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_163">163. Clouds to the North-East appeared, for the first Time, in

  <p>They <em>sailed</em> directly <em>under</em> it: filled up the Chasm, and

  <p id="section_164">164. It has been <em>since</em> imagined, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> a fresh Wind

    particularly as the lower Part of the <em>white</em> Flag vibrated only
    in the usual Direction.</p>

  <p id="section_181">181. The Sun shone <em class="smcap">bright</em> on both: and in a very few Minutes,
    the <em>circular</em> Prospects <em>encreased</em>: which was now become
    a <em>regular</em> and undeniable Signal that the Balloon had begun to
    <em>descend</em>. (<a href="#section_17">Section 17</a>.)</p>

  <p>The <em>latter</em> Plain appeared, at the first, about the Size of a

  <p>The Balloon continued to descend.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The same Spot perpetually varying to the Eye of the
    Aironaut.</div>

  <p id="section_182">182. In a Couple of Minutes, the Plain appeared intersected

    Melon</em>. Descending a little <em>lower</em>; it seemed covered with a
    <em>Net</em>, the <em>Meshes</em> of which were distinct. And <em>lower</em>
    still; it extended itself <em>greatly</em> on <em>all</em> Sides: (at which
    Time a certain Degree of <em>Chilliness</em> prevailed:) and was then
    <em>again mistaken</em>, and looked upon as a <em class="smcap">dry</em> <em>Heath</em>,
    deeply overrun with Shrubs of the same Name.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Ballast thrown out gradually.</div>

  <p id="section_183">183. The Descent of the Balloon being <em>rather</em> quicker than was
    expected, or desired; it was deemed expedient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> to have Recourse to
    the <em>last</em> Bag of Sand, which lay open, and weighed 20 Pounds.</p>

  <p>It was accordingly thrown out, a Handful at a Time.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The remaining Ballast thrown out <em>at once</em>, in all

  <p>But that Method not seeming <em>sufficient</em> to <em>check</em> the

  <div class="sidenote">Gentle Landing of the Balloon.</div>

  <p>This had the desired Effect: and the Balloon continuing to descend with

  <div class="sidenote">Anchor and Cable not made use of.</div>

  <p id="section_184">184. There being scarcely a <em>Breath</em> of Air abroad, the Aironaut
    made no Use of his Anchor and Cable: but continued as from the first,
    <em class="smcap">standing</em> <em>upright</em> in the Car; which, having moved a
    Yard or two <em>only</em> along the Ground, rested in a perpendicular Situation.</p>

  <p>The Balloon, suspended over him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> like a <em>vast</em> Umbrella,
    <em class="smcap">levitated</em> <em>vertically</em> in the grandest Manner.</p>

  <p id="section_185">185. He was <em>alone</em> when he alighted: but, in a <em>few</em>

    <em>above Ancle-deep</em>, and came running from all Parts, to see the

  <h3>Rixton-Moss, <em class="smcap">Lancashire</em>, IV. o’Clock P.M.</h3>

  <p>The Afternoon being <em>fine</em>, the Sun <em>bright</em>, and the Air
    <em>calm</em>; finding the Country People remarkably civilized and kind;
    and having dispatched a Messenger on Foot to return in a Post Chaise
    from Warrington; the Aironaut was resolved to gratify the Curiosity of
    his numerous Followers, and give the young People a Taste for Balloons,
    by treating them successively with an Airing.</p>

  <p id="section_194">194. Indeed it was no inconvenient Method of removing and conducting
    the Machine: and <em>possibly</em> different Positions of the Balloon
    might furnish a <em>useful</em> Hint.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Aironaut indulged the People of the Country with
    <em>Flights</em> in the Balloon.
  </div>

  <p>Having asked aloud <em>who chose to ride</em>, several answered in the
    Affirmative. So having pitched upon a young Fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> of less Weight
    than himself; bid him get up, between the Cords, over the Hoop, into the
    Car; stand near the Middle, and hold an opposite Cord in each Hand.</p>

  <p>He obeyed with the greatest Alacrity: and seemed to be <em>a noisy bold</em> Adventurer.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Aironaut <em>first</em> quitted the Car; but continued to
    <em>conduct</em> the Balloon.
  </div>

  <p id="section_195">195. The <em>Aironaut</em> then got out; and having suffered the Balloon
    to rise; fastened the End of the Cable to <em>central</em> Meshes of
    the Net, at the Bottom of the Car: ordering the strongest and tallest
    Man to hold the Cable, and let it go by Degrees till the Anchor or
    grappling Iron <em>alone</em> remained in his Hand.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Behaviour of different Adventurers.</div>

  <p>The Balloon now rising <em>above</em> the Height of the Trees, and giving
    the Adventurer a new and extensive Prospect of the Country; he became
    <em>silent</em>; <em>pale</em>; his <em>Countenance</em> the <em>Picture</em>
    of <em>Distress</em>; looking <em>down</em> as if for <em>Help</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

  <p>The Conductor repeatedly bid him take Courage. But, in vain.</p>

  <p>By lowering the Car <em>within</em> the Height of the Trees, he seemed to
    <em>recover</em> from his <em>Dismay</em>.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <figure class="divider"><img src="images/divider.jpg" alt=""></figure>
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"><span class="gesperrt2">CHAPTER&nbsp; </span>XXXV.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_196">Section 196.</span> THE Route of the Balloon being now throu’ a <em>flat
    woody</em> Country, with <em>tall</em> Trees growing in the Hedge Rows;
    a Difficulty occurred, how to conduct the Cable, when the Balloon was
    <em>above</em> or <em>between</em> the Trees, without entangling: which
    gave the Conductor much Trouble, as he was frequently obliged to walk
    round a Field, the Balloon being held in the Center, before he coud
    espy a proper Opening.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">March of the Balloon.</div>

  <p>The Procession marched slowly forward: and the young Man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
    carried among <em>his Peers</em> in Triumph through the Air, across
    the Turnpike-Road, into the Middle of an open Grass Field, where he
    descended; took a Companion <em>less heavy</em>, and left the Car.</p>

  <p>This Stripling was a good Deal surprised the Instant he rose above the
    Trees; but ventured to look around: and appeared on the <em>whole</em>
    much delighted.</p>

  <p id="section_197">197. A great Concourse of People were now collected.</p>

  <p>Accidental Carriages halted: joined the Cavalcade, and partook of the
    Diversion: the <em>greater</em> Part following the Balloon throu’ the
    <em>open</em> Fields adjoining the Road.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Caution to prevent the Escape of the Balloon.</div>

  <p>The Conductor <em>generally</em> preferring the beaten Track; yet
    <em>suspecting</em> the Balloon with its Adventurer in the Car, might
    <em>designedly</em> be suffered to <em>escape</em>, took the Precaution to
    have the Grapple held by <em>nearest</em> Relations to the Person in the Car.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

  <p id="section_198">198. The Gass evaporating; a smart young Fellow, who seemed ready for
    the Jaunt, stepped in: on which the former resigned his Place. But
    he was no sooner raised a few Yards above his Companions, than the
    <em>florid</em> Colour forsook his Cheeks; he <em>trembled</em>; bent
    himself <em>double</em> with Fright; and the Balloon was obliged to be
    hauled down.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">A Venus in the Car of the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_199">199. A fond Mother then requested that her Child, a fine blooming Girl,
    might ascend: boasting of her Courage, and comparing it with that of
    the Person who had none.</p>

  <p>The <em>Venus</em> smiled, and mounted her Car with great Spirit.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Politeness of the neighbouring Gentlemen.</div>

  <p id="section_200">200. Some Ladies and Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood who had watched
    the Balloon, while it hung at an immense Height over Lymm, and the
    Gunpowder Works on the River Mersey, came, in their Evening Walk,
    to meet it: joined the Procession; gave the Aironaut <em>polite</em>
    Invitations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> to their Houses, and shewed him every possible
    Civility.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Effect of Air in <em>Motion</em> on the Surface of the
    Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_201">201. The Resistance made by the <em>Surface</em> of the Balloon,
    against the <em>least Breath</em> of Air moving <em>horizontally</em>,
    was <em>frequently</em> tried by occasionally holding the Grapple:
    and it was a decided Point, that the <em>least Motion of the Air</em>
    was sufficient, together with the Action of <em>Levitation</em>, to
    prevent the Person, who held the Grapple when the Cable was extended,
    from transporting the Balloon against the Current: nay it was with
    Difficulty he coud remain in the <em>same</em> Place: the Balloon
    sometimes pulling him forwards, and almost off his Feet.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Effect of <em>calm</em> Air on the Surface of the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_202">202. When the Air was perfectly <em>calm</em>, which frequently happened
    while the Balloon migrated with different Passengers, as the Evening
    was the finest in the World, and the Country flat and woody in the
    Hedge-Rows; it was with <em>Difficulty</em> that the Conductor coud draw
    the Balloon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> after him, faster than the Rate of a moderate
    <em>Walk</em>: viz. three Miles an Hour.</p>

    <em>then</em> near that Time, the Post-Chaise was <em>not</em> arrived.</p>

  <p id="section_204">204. On Enquiry for a dry smooth Meadow, he was recommended to proceed
    a little farther, to a Place on the Road within three Miles of
    Warrington.</p>

  <p id="section_205">205. Having by this Time gratified the Curiosity of the Country in
    admitting Boys and Girls to the Age of six or seven Years, into the
    Car; and being arrived after Sun-set at the Place appointed, viz.
    <em>Milton’s Croft-Green</em>; he ordered the Balloon to be laid on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
    its Side along the Ground: having removed the Car, and opened the Mouth;
    the inflammable Air or Gass, was soon pressed out by Means of a <em>long
    Pole</em> rolled <em>across</em> it by two Men, standing one at each End
    of the Pole: beginning at the Top or upper Valve, which was held down
    close to the Ground; and ending at the Mouth or Neck.</p>

  <p>It was then rolled up, put into the Car; and the whole Apparatus placed
    on the Top of the Chaise which arrived the Moment wanted.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon put up at 53 Minutes past VI.</div>

  <p id="section_206">206. The Operation was completed at 53 Minutes past VI: the Conductor
    having accompanied the Balloon on Foot exactly <em class="smcap">three</em> Hours.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Balloon in the Air five Hours and a Quarter.</div>

  <p id="section_207">207. The Balloon had therefore continued <em>floating</em> in the Air,
    with different Persons, in the whole, for the Space of five Hours and a
    Quarter.</p>

  <p>The Conductor, promising to accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> the very polite Invitation
    offered him by Mr. <em>Stanton</em>, a Gentleman who is principally concerned in
    the Gunpowder-Works upon the Mersey; called at his House, and partook
    of some Refreshments.</p>

  <p>He then drove to Warrington, where he was met by a Person whom
    Curiosity had inspired to follow the Balloon <em>on Foot</em> from
    Chester, as long as he coud keep it <em>in View</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_208">208. Mr. Lunardi likewise with great Civility dispatched his Servant
    to assist the Aironaut in <em>the Care</em> of the Balloon; but he did
    not arrive in Time; not reaching Warrington till VIII. at Night: having
    lost Sight of the Balloon about <em>Daresbury</em>, four Miles from
    Warrington.</p>

  <p id="section_209">209. Nor was it visible to any, at least very few, of the Inhabitants
    of that Town, which was equally hidden from the Aironaut: who,
    <em>then</em> ignorant of his Situation, must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> remained a
    considerable Time suspended above the Clouds; which concealed both the
    Town and River.</p>

  <p>He saw Warrington but twice when <em class="smcap">above</em>: for a short Time, at a
    great Distance, and a <em>mediate</em> Altitude.</p>

  <p id="section_210">210. The following Day he returned to Chester: was met by the
    Militia-Music, and ushered with loud Huzzaes into his native City.</p>

  <p>On his safe Arrival; besides the private and sincere Congratulations
    of his Relations and Friends; the Bells rang: his Flags were carried
    in Procession, and every public Demonstration of Joy was shewn on the
    Occasion.</p>

  <p>Answer: It appears to the Observer, that the <em>Thunder</em> was
    <em>gradually</em> collecting in the Air from <em>Thursday</em> till
    Sunday: and if so; will not Balloons, when more <em>frequent</em>,
    prognosticate the Weather, <em>by Sight</em>, better than any other known

  <h3>ON CERTAIN APPEARANCES AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES OF THE BALLOON.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">Of the highest visible Clouds which are always <em>white</em>.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_213">Section 213.</span> THE highest visible <em>white</em> Clouds, often seen in
    detached Streaks, during the finest and also in the worst Weather, (if
    not intercepted by lower Clouds) and which, when melting away, are
    known in some Counties by the common Appellation of Horse-Tails; and,
    suspended over Great-Britain, are frequently <em>marbled</em> or dappled
    by the Wind; putting on the Appearance of white Waves, like Sea-Sands
    ruffled and left by a rapid Tide;—had been disturbed, separated, and
    almost <em>melted</em> down by the <em>Storm</em> the Day preceding the Excursion.</p>

  <p>Two of them <em>only</em> were still visible in Streaks, near the Sun’s
    Place, at the first Ascent. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> seemed without Motion, and
    became afterwards <em>invisible</em>.</p>

  <p>Saussure, the celebrated Professor of Philosophy at Geneva, is very
    exact in his Definition, Description, and Height of these Appearances:
    and thinks it <em>probable</em>, their Situation may be “<em>at least
    fifteen English Miles above the Surface of the Earth</em>.”</p>

  <p><span lang="fr">“Car quand je considere ces fines Pommelures, &amp;c.”</span> “For when I consider
    these delicate Dapplings, which, in a Series of fair Weather, begin to
    cover the azure Vault of Heaven with a white and transparent Gauze, and
    which portend Rain a long Time before it happens; I am led to believe
    they occupy a very elevated Situation in the Atmosphere” (<cite class="upright">Essais sur
    l’Hygrometrie</cite>, P. 271.)</p>

  <p>It seems however that <em>Crosbie</em>, in his Excursion from Dublin
    on the 25th of January 1785, pierced throu’ and soared above these
    <em>fine Webs</em>, at the Height of 16 Inches by the Barometer in a
    <em>frosty</em> Air.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Of the <em>Chilliness</em> perceived at a certain Height.</div>

  <p id="section_214">214. It has been already noted, that at a certain Height, a Kind of
    <em class="smcap">chilliness</em> was perceived, not ascertainable by the Thermometer.</p>

  <p>The Sensation was <em>suddenly</em> impressed four Times, in ascending
    and descending to and from the same Height, viz. about 26 and 27
    Inches, equivalent to between 500 and 1000 Yards above the Surface of
    the Earth at the first Ascent.</p>

  <p>From the Uniformity of Effect at the same Height; the Sensation may be
    ascribed to the same Cause, viz. the Level of the first or lower Tier
    of Clouds: altho’ the Aironaut did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> pass throu’ any visible
    Cloud or Vapour, during the Excursion. See <a href="#section_93">Section 93</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Remarkable Appearances of Earth and Clouds.</div>

  <p id="section_215">215. At the same Height likewise, tho’ the Observations have not been
    set down at large; the Appearances of the Earth and Clouds were very remarkable.</p>

  <p>During the Ascent of the Balloon, between the Altitudes of 26 and
    27 Inches; the <em>circular</em> Prospects of the subjàcent Earth
    <em>instantly</em> contracted, and, during the Descent, about the same
    Height, <em>instantly</em> enlarged themselves to the Eye of the Aironaut.</p>

  <p id="section_216">216. At the same Height mentioned before, the <em>circular</em> Prospects
    of the Clouds appeared on the same horizontal Plane with the Eye: tho’
    at the Distance of a Mile. See <a href="#section_49">Section 49</a>.</p>

  <p>In <em>this</em> Situation, the Observer endeavoured to discover the
    Thickness of the <em>Stratum</em> of Clouds: but was always baffled by a
    Deception of Sight worth recording.</p>

  <p>The <em>Strata</em> were plainly composed of three or more Heights of
    Clouds, <em>sailing</em> at great Intervals, one above the other: all
    which regularly <em>vanished</em>, as he approached their respective
    Levels: as if <em>instantly</em> thrown into the Circumference of a
    Circle, whose Radius was a Mile.</p>

  <p>During the Ascent, in passing their supposed Level, the Clouds
    <em>instantly</em> appeared <em>far below</em> him: and during the Descent,
    as far <em>above</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_217">217. Quere: Is it not from the same Cause, that all Vapour is
    <em>generally</em> invisible to a certain Height and Distance from the Eye?</p>

  <p>It being incontrovertible that more Vapours rise about <em class="smcap">noon</em>,
    than at any other Hour, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> at Sea, while the Sun
    continues to <em>shine</em>; which, notwithstanding, are wholly <em>invisible</em>,
    till arrived at a <em>certain</em> Height?</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Visibility of Vapours by mere Distance.</div>

  <p>And hence the Visibility of Vapours by <em>mere</em> Distance, which
    contains a sufficient Number of Particles to intercept and refract the
    Light, without Cold, Condensation, or <em>actual</em> Accumulation: viz.
    by Refrangibility of those primary Rays of Light, which Air and Vapour
    united are most <em>apt</em> to reflect or transmit.</p>

  <p>Mons. Saussure has proved by his Horse-Hair comparàble Hygrometer,
    that “the Air shews Signs of <em>greatest</em> Humidity an Hour after
    Sunrise, and of <em>least</em> Humidity, between three and four in the
    <em>Afternoon</em>.” But the Air being <em>then</em> also the hottest, will
    <em>dissolve</em> or evaporate the greatest Quantity of Vapours, and
    raise them <em>above</em> the Hygrometer (which by its <em>Heat</em> will
    not retain, but on the contrary repel and <em>dissipate</em> them) to
    great Heights in the Atmosphere.</p>

  <p>See “<cite class="upright">Essais sur l’Hygrometrie</cite>, C. 6, P. 315.”</p>

  <p id="section_218">218. In general then:</p>

  <p>Is not the <em>Cause</em> of the above Deceptions, <em>not</em> an
    <em>Absence</em>, but a <em>Transparency of Vapour</em> to a certain
    Distance: (just as the Zenith <em>appears</em> <em class="smcap">cloudless</em>,
    when the Air is <em>overcast</em> around;) beyond which Distance, the
    <em>Number</em> and relative Proximity of Particles with Respect to the
    Eye, is such, as to intercept the Rays of Light: <em>when only</em>, they
    put on the <em>Colour</em> of Air, and Form of Vapour and Cloud?</p>

  <p>And hence the probable Reason, why <em class="smcap">no</em> <em>circular</em> Horizon
    of the Earth’s Surface was presented during the Excursion, Section
    79: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> why it seldom has or can present itself to Aironauts or
    <em>Mountaineers</em>, at any <em>considerable</em> Height above the Region
    or Level of Clouds, even tho’ Clouds do <em>not</em> appear in the Air,
    either to themselves, or to Spectators <em>below</em>.</p>

  <p>This Point seems capable of Illustration by Analogy, from the
    Impossibility of encreasing the <em>Magnitude</em>, and at the same Time,
    <em>Distinctness</em> of distant Objects, seen throu’ a <em>common</em>
    Telescope; on Account of the Quantity of Vapours between them
    and the Eye <em>Which</em> <em class="smcap">vapours</em> may be magnified till
    the Object appears confused and obscure; and even at last become
    substituted in the Place of the Object, under the Form of Opacity and <em>Cloudiness</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_219">219. The <em>greater</em> the Height of the Balloon, the more
    <em>contracted</em> was the Circle of Vapour below it; and the more
    limited the Prospect of the Earth’s Surface below the Vapour.</p>

  <p id="section_220">220. It seemed probable that the Sun shone as <em>bright</em> on the
    Countries around the Observer, as on Objects immediately below him:
    which Objects coud not have been illuminated by the Sun’s Rays, darting
    throu’ the <em class="smcap">apparent</em> and <em>contracted</em> <em class="smcap">opening</em>
    under him; as the Rays which shone on the Balloon, fell beyond the
    <em>Opening</em>, <em>obliquely</em> on Clouds which caught the Shadow of
    the Balloon.</p>

  <p id="section_221">221. The extreme <em>Rarity</em> or <em>Tenuity</em> of the Vapours was
    <em>evident</em> from the <em>progressive</em> Course of the Balloon, which
    was <em>always</em> in the Center of a <em>circular</em> Opening, limiting
    the lower Prospects; except when the Spectator lost all Sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> of
    the Earth, by dense, watry, intervening Clouds.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Novel Situation peculiar to the Balloon, again described.</div>

  <p>This <em>august</em> central Situation, <span class="smcap">always changing yet still the
    same</span>, had the most striking Effect on the Senses and Imagination.
    Yet, however pleasing the Recollection of this <em class="smcap">glorious
    appearance</em>; however <em>strongly</em> impressed, accurately
    described, or richly painted; it must fall infinitely short of the
    original <em class="smcap">sensation</em>. Unity and Sameness were there contrasted
    with <em>perpetual Variety</em>: Beauty of Colouring; Minuteness, and
    consummate Arrangement;—with <em>Magnificence</em> and <em>Splendor</em>:
    <em>actual</em> Immensity;—with <em>apparent</em> Limitation:—all which
    were <em>distinctly</em> conveyed to the Mind, at the <em>same</em>
    Instant, throu’ the Intervention of the Organs of Sight: and, to
    complete the Scene, was added the Charm of <em class="smcap">novelty</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Recapitulation of the Scenery below.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_223">Section 223.</span> THE Earth’s Surface was presented to the Eye throu’ a
    <em>circular</em> Opening as already described.</p>

  <p>This Opening discovered a <em>Plain</em>, smooth and level as a Die: a
    Sort of <em>shining</em> Carpet, enriched with an endless Variety of
    Figures depicted <em>without</em> Shadow, as on a Map: what was really
    Shadow forming a separate Colour, and not considered at the Time, as
    <em>Shadow</em>. The Objects were distinctly marked, and perfectly known
    to be Miniatures of the Face of Nature.</p>

  <p>All was <em>Colouring</em>: no Outline: yet each Appearance curiously
    defined by a striking Contrast of simple Colours, which served to
    distinguish the respective Boundaries with most exact Precision, and
    inconceivable Elegance.</p>

  <p><em class="smcap">Red</em> Rivers, <em class="smcap">yellow</em> Roads, Enclosures <span
    class="smcap">yellow</span>
    and <em>light</em> <em class="smcap">green</em>, Woods and Hedges <em>dark</em>
    <em class="smcap">green</em>, were the only Objects clearly distinguishable,<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_175">175</span> and
    their Colouring extremely vivid. The Sun’s Rays reflected from the
    Surface of the Sea, and other Waters, dazzled the Sight.</p>

  <p><em class="smcap">All</em> living Creatures were invisible.</p>

  <p id="section_224">224. The Area of each Inclosure, computed to contain a certain Number
    of Acres, was seen from above under the Form of a Miniature Picture of
    a certain Magnitude or visible Extension, perpetually diminishing, as
    the Eye recedes to a greater Distance.</p>

  <p>And the Case is similar, whether the Miniature be seen from
    <em>above</em>, or <em>along</em> the Ground.</p>

  <p>The Miniature also lessens as the Distance encreases, according to a
    certain Proportion so exactly;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> That,</p>

  <p>1. If the <em>Distance</em> and <em>Magnitude</em> of a tangible Object be
    known by Mensuration; a Judgment is formed, and Laws laid down, for its
    corresponding <em>Miniature</em> on the Eye.</p>

  <p>2. If the <em>Miniature</em> be seen, and <em>Distance</em> known by
    Mensuration; the Mind forms a Judgment of its tangible <em>Magnitude</em>.</p>

  <p>3. And lastly, if the <em>Miniature</em> be seen, and <em>Magnitude</em> of
    a tangible Object is known by Mensuration; the Mind makes an Effort, to
    the Estimation of its Distance from the Eye.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

  <p>These are some, among many Modes of Comparison, by which the
    Mind acquires a tolerable Degree of Proficiency, in estimating
    <em>Distances</em> of familiar Objects, <em>known</em> from the Appearance
    of their respective Miniatures on the Fund or Bottom of the Eye.</p>

  <p>And so far most Theories agree.</p>

  <p>But such <em>ocular</em> Test is only true, while the Comparison is made
    in <em>nearly</em> the same Medium.</p>

  <p>For an Object, if seen at the same Distance <em>along</em> the Ground,
    will appear less as it rises above it; and least in the Zenith; as
    the Sun and Moon, at Setting or Rising, appear <em>large and oval</em>;
    but at their greatest Elevation, are <em>small</em> and <em>round</em>:
    because being seen, when passed out of a Medium impregnated with
    Vapours, which in some Measure intercept the Rays of Light: for the
    <em class="smcap">fainter</em>&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a distant Object
    appears, the <em>greater</em> it is apprehended to be.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

  <p>Possibly indeed an Object at the same Distance, if brighter at one
    Time than another, will <em>contract the Pupil</em> in Proportion to its
    Brightness: which may have the same Effect, as if the Object had made
    a <em>smaller</em> Miniature on the Retina; and will regularly strike
    the Mind with an Idea of <em>Magnitude</em>, <em>only</em> equal to its
    corresponding <em>Contraction</em>; i.&nbsp;e. less, when the Object is bright,
    and greater when faint.</p>

  <p id="section_225">225. If a like Reasoning be applied to the Ascent of Balloons; and it
    be said that they do not rise <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>so high as is imagined, because
    their Magnitude is diminished, merely from being elevated into a Portion of
    the Atmosphere <em>least</em> impregnated with Vapours; it will follow,
    that to a Spectator in the Balloon; known Objects on the Surface of
    the Earth below,—being seen from a rarer into a denser Medium, also
    into one which contains a great Quantity of Vapours;—shoud appear
    <em>larger</em>, than when seen along the Ground, at a Distance equal
    to its Height in the Balloon: all which is contrary to Matter of
    Fact: particularly if the Barometer gives a proper Estimate of the
    Height, of which there is little Doubt: a proper Allowance being made,
    <em>in certain Cases</em>, on Account of the Refraction: for, as before
    mentioned, (<a href="#section_44">Section 44</a>) Objects seen from the Balloon at a Mile and
    Half <em>barometric</em> Height, continued, with invariable Uniformity,
    to suggest the Idea of at least seven Miles.</p>

  <p id="section_226">226. By a general Comparison of Enclosures, and of separate Buildings
    when they coud be distinguished from the Balloon above the Region of
    Cloud, with the most distant Extremities, (on the horizontal Level) of
    Fields or Houses situated along the Sides of Hills or Mountains, at a
    known Distance by Miles, making Allowance for their being seen in a
    straight Line;—the latter seemed at least five Times <em>larger</em> than
    the <em>former</em>: supposing them at equal Distances.</p>

  <p>To give an Instance. Supposing the most distant Extremities of a known
    Building or Enclosure, situated on the Side of a Hill or Mountain,
    presented a Miniature of a <em>familiar</em> Magnitude to the Eye of the
    Spectator on the Ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> at the known Distance of a Mile and
    Half; the same Object when seen from the Balloon at the same <em>barometric</em>
    Height, appeared full five Times less.</p>

  <p>This Comparison was made by Memory, the Morning after the Excursion,
    tho’ suggested while in the Balloon, from the wonderful Minuteness of
    all Objects then presented to the Eye.</p>

  <p>The Author being likewise familiarized to judge of Heights; having
    been on several of the chief Mountains in Europe: also, of comparative
    Distances, from his Situation near a large City, in a populous,
    enclosed Country; on a high Plain, within View of the Sea, Mountains,
    Hills, Enclosures, Buildings, and Objects whose Magnitude and Distances
    were known.</p>

  <p id="section_227">227. The Balloon itself, a Globe twenty-five Feet in Diameter, was seen
    in the Air on the Day of Ascent, at the Distance of 19 Miles.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Magnitude of Objects seen from the Balloon compared with
    those of the Sun or Moon near the Meridian, when seen from below.</div>

  <p id="section_228">228. The Reason already given, for the Solution of the famous Question
    concerning the apparent Magnitude of the horizontal Moon, seems no
    less applicable to Objects on the Earth’s Surface, when seen from the
    Balloon: which <em>Diminution</em> of Objects <em>below</em> confirms the
    Defect of Dr. Smith’s Hypothesis.</p>

  <p>For, as they appeared <em>extremely bright</em>; being shone on by the
    Sun, and seen throu’ the Air in a perpendicular Line, containing the
    least possible Quantity of Vapour; the Brightness must have exceeded
    that of the same Objects, when seen along the Ground: and consequently
    the Miniatures of the former must have been less than the latter, and
    also their respective Distances <em>seem greater</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Recapitulation of Facts.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft">1.</span>COnjectures concerning the regular Tendency of the Balloon to
    <em>descend</em> on its <em>Approach</em> towards <em class="smcap">water</em>.</p>

  <p>2. Its <em>greatest</em> Descent, when in the Zenith, over the Middle of
    Rivers.</p>

  <p>3. Recovery and <em>Re-ascent</em> to the former Level, as it
    <em>recedes</em> from them.</p>

  <p id="section_229">Section 229. Article 1. On the first Ascent in the Castle-Yard,
    Chester, the Balloon gently moved towards the River Dee, and the Sea.</p>

  <p>And woud probably have gone out to Sea, if the ascensive Power had not
    presently raised it above the Influence of the Water; into an upper
    Current of Air, which was visible at that Time, and for two Hours
    before the Ascent, by the Motion of superior Clouds in a safe Direction
    towards the Land.</p>

  <p>229. 2. The Balloon was <em>affected</em> in passing across the River
    Goway, and Trafford Meadows, which are a Mile wide: first moving
    Westward, and again towards the Sea; making several Curves: then
    resting and <em>lingering</em> between Great and Little Barrow: as the
    Aironaut was <em>well</em> informed by Persons of <em>Veracity</em>, who
    observed it: his Attention being engaged at that Time by other Objects.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

  <p>229. 3. A proportionable Effect was observed in <em>crossing</em> a small
    Brook near Alvanley.</p>

  <p>229. 4. The River Wever and its broad Meadows above Frodsham-Bridge
    actually stopped the farther Progress of the Balloon: tho’ its Course
    was <em>merely</em> <em class="smcap">across</em> the River.</p>

  <p>The Deviation was gently tho’ <em>invariably</em> towards the
    <em class="smcap">sea</em>: and, if not <em>timely</em> prevented, the Balloon must
    have fallen in the Middle of the Channel.</p>

  <p>229. 5. The same Case woud have happened on the Re-ascent at Bellair;
    if the <em>levitating</em> Force had <em>not</em> as at first, overcome
    the Influence of the <em class="smcap">waters</em>, and lifted the Balloon into the
    <em>same</em> upper Current, which continued to move in its former safe
    Direction.</p>

  <p>229. 6. Different Branches of the Duke of Bridgewater’s Canal near
    Preston-Brook might <em>possibly</em> affect it in a small Degree: and,
    tho’ Clouds a little afterwards, secluded the Aironaut from a Sight of
    the Earth; yet the Balloon was known to hang, for some Time, over the
    Mersey near Warrington.</p>

  <p>229. 7. The Balloon descended and alighted on the Middle of a large
    Tract of wet Moss Ground.</p>

  <p>The Writer saw Sadler’s Balloon rise at Manchester, the 11th May, 1785,
    and descend near Blencow-Bridge, at the Conflux of <em>two</em> Rivers.</p>

  <p>The above Facts give sufficient Indications of the constant Tendency
    which Balloons have, to descend on Water.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_230">Section 230.</span> THREE Causes seem generally to concur in producing the
    Effect of Descent, over Water.</p>

  <p>1. The Water itself.</p>

  <p>2. The Air above it.</p>

  <p>3. Change of Temperature,</p>

  <p>Section 231. Article 1. So long as Gass escapes from the Balloon;
    it will be instantly and <em>reciprocally</em> attracted, throu’
    the <em>Crevices</em>, by the Moisture contained in the <em>Air</em>,
    particularly over <em>Rivers</em>: its specific <em>Gravity</em> within the
    Balloon, woud be encreased,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and consequently the
    Balloon itself rendered less buoyant:</p>

  <p>The Gass woud, on the contrary, be repelled by <em>electric</em> Air:
    which woud lessen its Tendency to escape, throu’ the Pores of the Silk.</p>

  <p>But it is <em>presumed</em> that Air-tight Balloons will be little
    affected by <em>external</em> Moisture.</p>

  <p>231. 2. Moist Air over Water being generally cooler than over the
    adjacent Land, will, so long as the Gass continues at its former
    Temperature, assist and raise the Balloon <em>thus</em> moving into a
    <em>denser</em> Stratum: but no sooner is the Balloon contracted by the
    external Cold, than it descends into a Medium of Air, whose specific
    Gravity is proportionable to the contracted Bulk of the Balloon, and
    rests when equal to it.</p>

  <p>231. 3. Water is also a Conductor of Electricity, tho’ a feeble
    one: and there is moreover a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>strong chemical Affinity between
    <em class="smcap">water</em>, inflammable Air, Gasses, Floguiston, and
    Electricity.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

  <p>231. 4. Water will therefore <em class="smcap">conduct</em> the Gass to itself: i.&nbsp;e.
    will draw the Balloon <em>downwards</em>, and with accelerating Velocity;
    as the Attraction is stronger, the nearer the Water.</p>

  <p>231. 5. But if the Air over the Water be warmer than that over Land;
    then the Balloon, moving into a warmer Medium, as over the Sea in
    frosty Weather, most undoubtedly descends: till the included Gass has
    received the additional Encrease of Temperature from that of the Air,
    at which Time it will have a Tendency to re-ascend, and will rest
    suspended in Equilibrio, as in the former Case.</p>

  <p>The above Causes however may be considered, as <em>trivial</em>.</p>

  <p>The first may be avoided by making the Balloon <em>Air-tight</em>:
    and the second easily guarded against by throwing out a little
    <em>Ballast</em>.</p>

  <p>The <em>only</em> formidable one, if any, is</p>

  <p><em class="smcap">the depression of the atmosphere</em>.</p>

  <p>This it will be necessary to consider with some Degree of Attention.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_232">Section 232.</span> WHOEVER consults Antiquity,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> or is
    acquainted with modern Mèteorism, will ascent to the Truth of the Facts there recited,
    viz. That the Storms of <em class="smcap">dispersion</em> called <em>Prester-John</em>,
    and <em>Ox-Eye</em> over Table Bay at the Cape of Good-Hope (not to
    mention those of <em class="smcap">collection</em>, as <em>Whirlwinds</em>&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
    and <em>Waterspouts</em>;) <em>descend</em> on Sea and Land from the
    <em>middle</em> Regions of the Air, often <em>perpendicularly</em>
    <em class="smcap">downwards</em>: and then blow violently from a Center, to all
    Parts of the Compass at once: a necessary Consequence of their beating
    <em>forcibly</em> upon the Land or Water.</p>

  <p>The Ancients maintained that the Origin, of Wind was a mere
    <em>Depression</em> and <em>Percussion</em> from the Cold of the middle
    <em>Region</em>: and it shoud be remarked that their Observations were
    made on the <em>Continent</em>, and in <em>warm</em> Climates.</p>

  <p>Now what is seen to Excess in the <em>hottest</em> and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span><em>coldest</em>
    Climates;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> most probably takes Place, in a less
    Degree, in temperate ones.</p>

  <p>Therefore, on a Change of Weather, the upper Atmosphere
    <em>descends</em>: whether its Effects are <em>Cold</em>, as in Winter;
    <em>Warmth</em>, as in Spring; <em>Wind</em> or <em>Wet</em>; at the proper
    Seasons of the Year.</p>

  <p id="section_233">233. The Balloon, with which Dicker Junior ascended at Bristol, April
    19, 1784, on a <em class="smcap">windy</em> Day, proved the Truth of the Conjecture:
    for tho’ the Aironaut threw out most of his Ballast; yet after each
    Ascent and Recovery, he was repeatedly darted <em>downwards</em>
    <em class="smcap">even</em> with the Ground.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

  <p id="section_234">234. A similar Event happened to Crosbie, in his Passage over the Sea
    from Dublin to England; for, tho’ he too discharged his Ballast, the
    Wind kept him <em>down</em> and <em class="smcap">even</em> with the Water.</p>

  <p>The Weather at that Time seems to have been an Εκνέφιας, Procella,
    Percussion, Squall, or Tornado, i.&nbsp;e. a Storm of <em class="smcap">depression</em>,
    and <em class="smcap">dispersion</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_235">235. The Eknèfiai Winds come from cool Points on each Side the North.</p>

  <p>Bacon also observes that all <em class="smcap">boisterous</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>Winds, as Procella,
    Typho, and Turbo, have the evident Direction of a Precipice, or
    Projection <em>downwards</em>, more than other Winds: they seem to rush
    down like a Torrent or Cascade: and are then reverberated or beat back
    from the Earth, in all Directions.</p>

  <p>Stubble, Corn, or Hay in the Meadows are raised, and spread around

  <p id="section_236">236. If then it be allowed to reason from that Analogy which took Place
    in most of the Cases already mentioned; the <em>gentler</em> Depression.
    of Balloons over Water in <em>milder</em> Weather, may be owing to a
    Cause somewhat similar, tho’ not so evidently an immediate Object of
    the Senses, viz. <em>an actual tho’ invisible Descent of Air upon the Water</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_237">237. Blanchard in his Passage over the Sea from Dover to Bologne in
    France, when near the Middle of the Channel, suffered an unexpected
    Depression, and at the same Time was nearly <em class="smcap">becalmed</em>.</p>

  <p>A <em class="smcap">calm</em> also took Place on the Irish Sea: which must have
    prevented Crosbie from landing,—without <em>Wings</em>, or some
    <em>propulsive</em> Machinery, connected with the Balloon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

  <p id="section_238">238. Lunardi rose from Liverpool when the Wind blew
    <em>boisterously</em>: yet was <em>becalmed</em> twenty Minutes over the
    <em>broad</em> Turn of the Mersey near Ince, when above the Level of the

    towards Beeston-Castle in Cheshire.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Depressing Columns of Air known to the Egyptians.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_239">Section 239.</span> THE Existence of depressing Columns of Air was well known
    to a People more ancient than either Romans or Greeks.</p>

  <p id="section_240">240. The sultry Climate of Egypt, whose Situation is that of an
    extensive Meadow watered by a <em>broad</em> River, and enclosed by
    Mountains to the East and West; consequently not subject to general
    horizontal Currents of Air, except along the Line of its Meridian,—is
    <em>the Country</em>, wherein Columns of <em class="smcap">cool</em> Air descending on
    the Water, woud be soon observed.</p>

  <p>And they, in Fact, were almost the only People who applied the
    Observation to common Life: having, according to Herodotus, as well
    as later Writers, built lofty Structures <span class="smcap">open at the top</span>. By
    which Means the cool Air <em class="smcap">rushing</em> downwards greatly refreshed
    the Inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The ancient Pantheon, at present called All Saints Church, now standing
    at Rome; built in the lowest Situation of a Street named the Piazza di
    Navona is on this Construction: and the Hint probably taken from an
    Egyptian Model.</p>

  <p id="section_241">241. In all inland Countries, whose Lakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> are frequently
    surrounded by Mountains, as Bala-Pool in North-Wales; those of Westmoreland
    and Cumberland; the Lake of Geneva in Swisserland;—the Air rushes
    <em class="smcap">forcibly</em> on the Surface of the Water in descending Torrents:
    this the Writer has frequently observed.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

  <p>(In other Languages, the Words applicable to Wind on a Lake, or the
    Ocean, signify Descent: as, <span lang="el">Καταβαινω</span>, and <span lang="el">Επικειμαι·</span> also the Northerly
    or <em>descending</em> Wind corresponded to the <span lang="el">Εκνὲφιας</span> while the
    Southerly or <em>ascending</em> Wind answered to the <span lang="el">Απογη</span>.)</p>

  <p>All this, which may be allowed to take Place in <em>bad</em> Weather,
    may perhaps be excepted to, in <em>fine</em>, and still more so, in the
    <em>finest</em> Weather.</p>

  <p>As the slightest Change is first observable on the Surface of Water,
    whether on Lakes or the Ocean, the <em>Descent of Air</em> in the finest
    Weather is familiar to Mariners by the Appellation of <em class="smcap">light
    airs</em>, playing in Eddies: and particularly in the <em>variable</em>
    Latitudes; i.&nbsp;e. between 32 and 42: to these the Writer can also
    witness: as well as on small and large inland Lakes, by partial
    <em>Dimplings</em> and <em>Rufflings</em> of the Surface.</p>

  <h3>OBJECTION TO THE THEORY REMOVED.</h3>

  <p id="section_242">242. It may be objected to the above Theory, that the Wind plainly
    blows in an horizontal Direction, as may be seen from the Motion of
    Clouds and Trees.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

  <p>To which it may be answered, that if Clouds are not beside the
    Question; as it is not asserted that a single Column of Air presses
    from so great a Height to the Earth; (tho’ it be the Case in Squalls;)
    yet it is extremely difficult to determine whether Clouds move in a
    Direction exactly parallel to the Plane of the Horizon: and it is much
    more probable that they are in a perpetual Change, <em>encreasing</em> or
    <em>melting</em>; rising or falling, according to the <em>Pressure</em> and
    specific Gravity of the <em>Medium</em> in which they float; its Tendency
    to Moisture or Driness, Cold or Heat; also the different Combinations
    and Decompositions, with Respect to which, the Atmosphere is in
    perpetual Variation.</p>

  <p>The Motion of Trees, if carefully attended to, seldom shew Effects of a
    regular horizontal Current.</p>

  <p>And since the more <em>powerful</em> the Wind; the more evident
    and accurate may be the Observation; it will be found, that the
    <em>first</em> general Effect is an oblique Depression, succeeded by
    a Recovery or instant Exaltation: then a momentary Pause, or actual
    Retreat of the Wind; and in a few Seconds, a Return of the depressing
    Torrent.</p>

  <p>But the strongest, and, at the same Time, an irrefragable Proof,
    is by <em>Appeal</em> to Men of <em>Science</em> in the Navy, or to
    skilful Pilots, who are conversant with Winds and Waves; who have
    weathered Storms off Cape Hatteras in Latitude 36; (where probably
    the Wind is perpetual;) or have made an East-India Voyage:—whether,
    if a Gale blew in an horizontal Direction <em class="smcap">only</em>; the Ocean
    coud produce such an Inequality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> Surface: or whether when the
    Sea runs <em class="smcap">mountains</em> <em>high</em>; the tremendous Surges
    must not arise from the <em>violent</em> Action of Winds repeated at
    Intervals, sometimes <em>descending</em> perpendicularly; but oftener in
    forcible elastic Torrents of oblique <em class="smcap">depression</em>, and instant
    <em>Resilition</em>?</p>

    in <em>fair</em> Weather.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_243">Section 243.</span>INtimations of depressing Columns in moderate Weather,
    are the <em>sluggish</em> Clouds, which often make their <em>first</em>

    <em>along</em> great Rivers, and Chains of Mountains, both during a Calm,

    <em>greater</em> Purity
    of the Air <em>during</em> such Descent.</p>

  <p id="section_244">244. As, therefore, it is plain that atmospheric Air <em class="smcap">descends</em>
    <em>frequently</em>, both in bad and fine Weather; if a Cause
    can be assigned so general, as to make it probable, that such
    <em class="smcap">depression</em> does almost continually take Place:—tho’ at present
    the Effect is only evident to the Senses, by actual Experiment in
    the Passage of Balloons throu’ such Columns;—it will be sufficient
    to put <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>Balloonists on their Guard against the Effects of such
    <em>Depression</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_245">245. In order to investigate the Theory of Depression; it may not be
    unacceptable, particularly to those who have not had Leisure to peruse
    the Experiments on Air, by Dr. Priestley, or the Collection on the same
    Subject by Cavallo;—just to extract a few short Quotations, on the
    chemical Affinities of Air and Water.</p>

  <p id="section_246">246. Article 1. “Water, as Rain, imbibes only the pure Air of the upper
    Regions, leaving the lighter and floguisticated Air to ascend.”&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"
      class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

  <p>246. 2. Felìcè Fontana says, “Common Air receives an Encrease of Bulk
    and <em>Elasticity</em> from being shaken in Water.”&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

  <p>246. 3. Air absorbs Water, and Water absorbs Air:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
    and the
    Absorption of Air by Water is promoted by Agitation: it also absorbs
    twice as much <em>defloguisticated</em> Air, as common Air:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
      class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the whole
    Bulk of the Air absorbed being equal to one-twelfth of the Bulk of the
    Water: yet the Bulk of the Water seems but <em>little</em> encreased: the
    Air being contained within the Interstices of the Water.</p>

  <p id="section_247">247. The following is a pretty and an easy Experiment, to shew how the
    <em class="smcap">absorption of water by air</em> takes Place, under the immediate
    Inspection of the Observer.</p>

  <p>Admitting the Sun’s Light into a Room, throu’ one Window only; pour a
    Pint of <em>boiling</em> Water into a large Bason: hold the Bason, which
    will not be half full, next the Light, in such a Manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> that the
    Sun
    may shine on the Water and Bason; yet the Eyes be shaded by the Top of
    the Window Frame.</p>

  <p>Incline the Side of the Bason towards the Light, so that the Water may
    rise even with the Top.</p>

  <p>The Eye being placed just above the upper Side of the Bason, farthest
    from the Light; look on the Water.</p>

  <p>You may then observe the Surface of the Water next the Light, refract
    the Sun’s Rays, and produce the primary Colours, particularly the
    <em class="smcap">red</em> and <em class="smcap">green</em>: which tho’ <em>transient</em>,
    <em>continue</em> to be <em>seen</em> in Succession; as Vapours rise
    above the Surface of the Water. Their <em>first</em> Ascent is plainly
    discoverable: remaining above its Surface, in the Form of <em>small
      Dust</em>, gently agitated, not <em>separately</em> but as a <em>whole</em>.
    Nor do they seem to rise into Steam, till assisted by the Action, and
    Contact of <em>dry Air</em>, which like <em>dry</em> Spunges, <em>licks
      off</em> and absorbs the small Dust already accumulated by the Force of
    the Heat from below, and then becomes visible under the Appearance of
    Steam, flying off in distinct hollow Vesicles.</p>

  <p>The more <em>still</em> the Air of the Room, the more slowly will the
    Spunges of Air come in Contact with the Body of small Dust.—Besides the
    small Dust already mentioned; the Heat will detach solid Globules of
    Water; which will remain floating on the Surface of the Body of Water:
    till the dry Air descends and transports them with it; the Air at the
    same Instant dissolving the solid Globules into hollow Vesicles.</p>

  <p>But the most extraordinary Phenomenon, and which cannot be mistaken,
    is, that as soon as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> Spunge of Air has dipped into the Surface
    of
    Water, and received its Lading; the Vesicles continue to accumulate,
    till another fresh Spunge descends in a similar Form, which may be
    traced upon the Surface of the Water, and seen in its Shadow, or rather
    in Beams of Light at the Bottom of the Bason, at the Instant it has
    flown off with its Burden: for that Part of the Surface of the Water
    transmits new Rays of Light, on Removal of the Vapour carried away by
    the Dip and Play of Air.</p>

  <p id="section_248">248. The Removal of the Vapour, likewise exhibits a curious Appearance
    on the Surface of the Water: which seems as if divided into irregular
    Parcels detached from each other; like the reticular Daplings visible
    on the under Side of Clouds elevated to the highest Stratum of the
    Atmosphere, and there evaporating or dissolving.</p>

  <p id="section_249">249. So powerful is the Attraction between Air and Water; that, while
    the Steam is rising above and round the Sides of the Bason; <em>Waves
      of fresh Air</em>, by Intervals, press the exterior Parts of the Steam
    <em>inwards</em>, in order to get at the Surface by descending into the
    Bason.</p>

  <p>This Operation is best discovered, when the Bason is held <em>even</em>.
    And the whole Process may be observed more distinctly, if the Bason
    is raised and fixed on a Frame, near the Height of the Eye of the
    Observer, standing upright: who will then be able to trace minutely
    the exact Form of the Steam, and Insinuation of the Waves of Air into
    the Center of each Curl, or rising Curvature: an Appearance, similar
    to which, may be seen in <em>Water</em> flowing from a small Orifice
    in a close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> Vessel; the fresh Air forcibly entering in an opposite
    Direction; forming a visible Cavity and Curvature in the Center of the
    Stream. See Halley’s Experiments on Evaporation in the open Air, and in
    a close Room, in Lowthorp’s Abridgement of the Phil. Trans. Vol. 2, P.
    108.</p>

  <p>Having once remarked the foregoing Process at Leisure; the same
    may be seen over any open Vessel of Water just warm enough to emit
    visible Steam: but the Air shoud be as <em>still</em> and <em>calm</em> as
    possible: the Steam never rising from all Parts of the Surface at once;
    but a depressing Spunge of Air always descends to the Surface, the
    Instant a Lamina of Vapour has been detached.</p>

  <p>Such is the regular and invariable Process of Evaporation.</p>

  <p>The same Process may be distinctly traced over the Surface of a Piece
    of Water or River, the Air being perfectly calm, in a gentle Frost,
    at Sunrise, particularly in Autumn, while the Water retains a Warmth
    superior to that of the Air.</p>

  <p id="section_250">250. Hence it follows that <em>as much light</em>&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
    and <em>warm</em>
    Air as is raised with the Steam by Evaporation from the Surface
    of any Water; <em>so much heavy</em> and <em>cool</em> Air is
    <em class="smcap">instantaneously</em>, constantly, and forcibly <em class="smcap">depressed</em>
    upon its Surface, in order to supply the Vacancy, restore the
    Equilibrium, and continue the Evaporation.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

  <p id="section_251">251. Now, besides the mutual Affinity that Water has to almost all
    Kinds of Air, and to Floguiston; added to its Power of Absorption; and
    as the <em class="smcap">sea</em>, particularly in Summer, also <em class="smcap">rivers</em> and
    <em>damp</em> <em class="smcap">meadows</em> are generally <em>cooler</em> than the Lands
    and Countries bordering on them; Currents of <em>damp cool</em> Air press
    forwards to supply the Defect or Vacancy caused by Heat, Rarefaction
    and Elevation of <em>dry warm</em> Air, which is necessarily, and almost
    constantly rising into the Atmosphere, from heated Lands, Plains, and
    gentle Eminences <em>long shone</em> on by the Sun.</p>

  <p id="section_252">252. Consequently the pure, cool, defloguisticated Atmosphere, is
    almost continually descending from above; sometimes imperceptibly,
    often <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>forcibly, on the Surface of the Sea, the Channels of
    Rivers, Meadows, and all wet Land. Which Depression acts, in Proportion to its
    Strength, on the Balloon; and always with a sensible Effect: for, being
    in Equilibrio with the Air at all stationary Heights; the <em>least</em>

  <p id="section_253">253. This Reasoning is, in many Cases, applicable to the Air, and
    consequently the Weather and Cold of Mountains.</p>

  <p>Nor can it otherways be accounted for, why the Snow is perpetual,

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_254">Section 254.</span> THE Subject of <em class="smcap">depressing torrents</em> requires an
    accurate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> Investigation: as it will serve to point out the proper
    Time of Day or Night, when an Aironaut ought so to calculate his Voyage, as
    to arrive over the Middle of the Channel, or Arm of the Sea, at some
    particular Hour: in order to wait for a Sea Breeze which may waft him
    to the other Side.</p>

  <p>A Point not difficult to be ascertained.</p>

  <p>Also, this Idea of <em class="smcap">depression</em>, if properly considered and
    digested; may prove a sufficient Foundation on which to establish a new
    Theory of the <em>Weather</em>, so ill determined at present, from its
    <em>aggregate Weight</em> or <em>Elasticity</em> only, as indicated by the
    Barometer.</p>

  <p id="section_255">255. If a Conjecture may be formed on a Subject, material in itself,
    yet of which so little is actually known; woud not <em>the proper
    Time</em> of undertaking a Voyage over the Channel be such, that
    the Aironaut shoud find himself three Parts of the Way across, by
    <em class="smcap">nine</em> <em>o’Clock</em> in the Morning?</p>

  <p id="section_256">256. In <em>warmer</em> Climates, where the Seasons are more regular; the
    <em>Land-Breeze</em> blows to Sea from Midnight till X. in the Morning:
    at which Time, the <em>Sea-Breeze</em> blows to Land; continues till V.
    or VI. in the Evening; and is succeeded by a <em class="smcap">calm</em>, which lasts
    till Midnight.</p>

  <p>Whence it follows, that during the Time of the Sea-Breeze, there is
    a constant Tendency towards a <em class="smcap">gulph of air</em>, <em>along the
    Middle</em> of the Channel: the Equilibrium of which is as constantly
    supplied by a <em>Depression</em> of the upper and in general cooler
    Strata of Air; and therefore a <em>dangerous</em> Time for the Passage of Balloons.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

  <p>On the contrary, during the Night, and till ten in the Morning,
    there is an <em>Accumulation</em> of Air, <em>along the Middle of
    the Channel</em>: which consequently is a proper Time to ensure a
    <em>safe</em> Passage; by the Assistance of <em class="smcap">wings</em>, or some
    <em class="smcap">propulsive</em> Machinery.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Of the horizontally calm mediocèanal depressing Current.</div>

  <p id="section_257">257. The Deficiency or Vacuity being supplied from the etherial
    Regions; it might be taken for granted, that such Ether must be
    <em>considerably</em> lighter than the adjacent common Air on an equal
    Level, and therefore <em>proportionably</em> dangerous for the Passage of Balloons.</p>

  <p>But if it be considered that such Air, acting as a <em class="smcap">wedge</em>,
    or more probably in the Form of an hyperbòlic Solid,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68"
    class="fnanchor">[68]</a> to fill up
    the Vacuity, descends with Rapidity from a <em>colder</em> Atmosphere
    impregnated with aqueous Vapours <em>invisible from below</em>;
    and that both the Air and Vapour have reciprocal Affinities and
    Attractions, electric and mechanical, with the Body of Water beneath
    them; and are often rendered still cooler by its constant Agitation
    and <em>Evaporation</em>; also, that the Supply being immediate and
    cotemporary, with the <em class="smcap">double tide of air</em> flowing from the
    <em>middle</em> over the <em>opposite</em> Shores;—there possibly may be
    little or no Difference between the aggregate or <em>barometric</em>
    Gravity of <em>such</em> Columns, and those which are formed by the
    Sea-Breeze on either Side of them: therefore the Descent of Balloons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
    is owing, among other Causes, to an almost perpendicular actual
    Depression of the superincumbent Atmosphere.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

  <p>Following up the Idea of a Sea-Breeze, blowing, at a Medium, for 20
    Miles over Land; altho’ the Stratum of the <em class="smcap">lower current</em> of
    Air, or Sea Breeze, may not exceed <span class="smcap">half a mile in depth</span>,
    measuring from the Ground upwards; nearly equal to 26 Inches of the
    Barometer <em>above</em>, the Thermometer also <em>above</em> being at 55,
    i.&nbsp;e. <em>Temperate</em>:—yet this Observation may prove of essential
    Service, while the <span class="smcap">upper current</span> of Air, i.&nbsp;e. the general Wind
    blows <em class="smcap">towards</em> the Sea, (which will be found to take Place more
    <em>frequently</em> than is, at present, imagined;) or while the Balloon
    is influenced that Way; as was the Case with Sadler and his Companion
    when over the Nore: who, on his accidental and sudden Descent,
    fortunately found Safety in the <em class="smcap">sea-breeze</em>.</p>

  <p>Which Breeze was sought for, and made Use of by the Author, when in the
    Balloon, near Frodsham, in Cheshire.</p>

  <p>For, as the Sea-Breeze is pretty general, Aironauts shoud not be too
    apprehensive: as they have it in their Power, by proper Management,
    to drop into the Breeze—for <em class="smcap">either shore</em>: if they are
    provided with a Machinery to waft themselves across the intermediate
    <em>depressing</em> or <em>accumulating</em> <em class="smcap">mediocèanal column of
    air</em>: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>which Space, between the two Shores, is, as before
    hinted, frequently <em class="smcap">becalmed</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_258">258. Further: as the above Theory of a <em>mediocèanal</em> Depression
    seems to receive additional Confirmation from <em>each</em> Balloon
    Experiment; Lunardi <em>descending</em> on the 5th of October last, when
    near the Middle of the Bay of Edinburgh or Firth of Forth;—it may be
    found <em>prudent</em>, to keep the Balloon continually rising, till the
    Aironaut is <em>one-third</em> of the Passage <em>over</em>.</p>

  <p>258. 2. For if the general Wind in the upper Current be not strong;
    the Aironaut may expect to be <em>becalmed</em>, with Respect to the
    horizontal Direction of the Current, the Instant he finds, by the Rise
    of the Barometer, that the Balloon <em>descends</em>; i.&nbsp;e. when it is
    acted upon by the depressing Column: in which Case, the <em>higher</em>
    he has soared, the <em>safer</em>: as he will have more Room and greater
    <em>Latitude</em> for Exertion by Means of the Machinery: which Machinery
    will be greatly <em>aided</em> by the Force of the descending Column or
    Gravity; and will act on a similar Principle with the Ferry-Boats over
    the River Po in Italy; which are a Sort of horizontal Pendulum. For the
    Aironauts will continue to <em>descend</em>, at the same Time that their
    <em>Wings</em> furnish the Means of a progressive Motion.</p>

  <p>Therefore, before the Time that the Balloon has reached the Surface
    of the Water; they will have crossed the depressing Column; and find
    themselves wafted <em>gently</em> by the <em>new</em> Sea-Breeze setting in
    towards the opposite Shore.</p>

  <p id="section_259">259. If the Aironaut <em>rises up</em> to Sea with a Wind blowing from
    the Land on each of the opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> Sides of the Channel, and
    arrives above the Middle of the Channel, while the same Wind remains; it is
    probable that the Balloon will continue to rise higher as he proceeds
    towards the Middle, <em>where</em> the <em class="smcap">mediocèanal accumulation</em>
    has for some Hours taken Place; and therefore he need not be under any
    Apprehension of falling: but, as before, it being probable he will also
    be <em>becalmed</em>; the Necessity of propulsive Machinery is equally
    urgent, in order to pass the Center of the <em>Accumulation</em>: after
    which, the Balloon will ride Home to the opposite Shore in the new
    Sea-Breeze, by <em>that</em> Time, just beginning to set in.</p>

  <p id="section_260">260. With the Assistance of propulsive Machinery, it is imagined the
    Aironaut may be enabled in a few Minutes to force throu’ the calm
    mediocèanal Accumulation, or Depression: after which, he will have
    little Occasion to make Use of it.</p>

  <p id="section_261">261. <em class="smcap">Sunrise</em> is, probably, the <em class="smcap">safest</em> Time of all,
    to ascend towards the Sea, with an <em>Air-tight</em> Balloon: arriving
    with the Assistance of the Wings, throu’ the <em>calm</em> mediocèanal
    Accumulation: and there waiting till the new <em>Sea-Breeze</em> sets in
    to the <em>opposite</em> Shore.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Difficulties, proposed by Mons. Sauffure stated; and their
    Solution attempted.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_259a">Section 259.</span> IT may be observed here, that the two Difficulties
    proposed by Sauffure, are, in a great Measure, removed; in admitting
    the Doctrine of mediocèanal <em>Depression</em>, and consequent alternate
    <em>Accumulation</em>,</p>

  <p>In a distinct Chapter, treating of the Variation of the Barometer,
    which he allows has Need of farther Explanation; he asks (Page 308)
    what Reasons can be assigned, why the <em>East</em> Winds, which are
    <em>cold and dry</em>, make the Barometer <em>descend</em>, in England
    and Holland: yet, the <em>West</em> Winds, which are <em>moist and
    temperate</em>, make it <em>rise</em>?</p>

  <p>The East Winds <em>here</em> blow chiefly in Spring.</p>

  <p>Now it is universally agreed, that the Sea, is sooner heated by the Sun
    than the Land: and on Account of the marine Acid exhaled,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
    class="fnanchor">[70]</a> is also
    less cold,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> during that Season, in the same
    Latitude.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

  <p>In Spring, therefore, the great Atlantic or Western Ocean, being
    <em>less</em> cold than England, Holland, and Eastwards; the Air pendent
    over the most extensive Tract of <em>dry and cool Land</em> in the World,
    rushes Westwards to supply the Equilibrium of <em>warm light</em> Air
    rising upwards, and causing a temporary mediocèanal Accumulation: which
    (altho’ the specific Gravity of the cold Air is greater) must produce
    an actual Deficiency in the aggregate Weight of the Atmosphere over
    England and Holland: consequently the Barometer falls.</p>

  <p>Again: the West Winds which blow at other Seasons; if, in Winter;
    are not frequent, except about Noon after frosty Nights which have
    equalized the Air for the Transmission of vigorous Sunshine: and shoud
    be looked upon as (what they are really observed to be) <em>low</em>
    partial Sea-Breezes, or <em class="smcap">eddy</em> <em>Currents</em>, insinuating
    themselves near the Surface, and setting Eastwards frequently against
    the upper and more general Winds; and therefore produce a temporary
    Accumulation.</p>

  <p>If, in Summer; the Supply of cool Air to the heated Land, being made
    not only from the <em>Northern Ocean</em>, and lofty <em>Mediterrànean
    Mountains</em>; but also from the <em>Atlantic Breezes</em>; the latter,
    tho’ <em>moist and temperate</em>, must also tend towards an Accumulation
    of the Atmosphere over England and Holland: and therefore the Barometer
    rises.</p>

    Accumulation and depression.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_260a">Section 260.</span> BEFORE the Subject of mediocèanal Accumulation and
    Depression of Air, is wholly quitted; it may be well mention and
    compare a few Facts and Observations, which will elucidate the
    Doctrine; and in their Turn, receive Light from it.</p>

  <p id="section_261a">261. If, in the Middle of a <em>hot sunny</em> Day, Vapours lighter
    than the Air, were to rise from the Ocean, (which they will continue
    to do, in hollow Vesicles or Bladders, till the Expansion breaks the
    Bubble, at which Time the Water woud fall to the Earth, if not drank
    up by the Attraction of <em>dry</em> Spunges of Air;) there woud be a
    constant Wind blowing from <em>Land to Sea</em>, to fill up the Chasm:
    but at such Time, the Land is more heated than the Sea: therefore
    hot Air and Vapour arise from both; and the Breeze, on the contrary,
    blows from <em>Sea to Land</em>; consequently if the Vacuities were not
    <em>continually</em> supplied from the etherial Regions, and from the
    Ocean, all Animals woud actually die, for Want of Air, as in a <em>hot
    close</em> Room.</p>

  <p>Such Supply is therefore constantly made, by Depression of the
    Atmosphere, and Absorption of the Water.</p>

  <p id="section_262">262. What happens on a great Scale, above the Ocean, as <em>before</em>
    hinted; probably, happens on a smaller, over Channels or Arms of
    the Sea: and on a still smaller; over and along Rivers, Brooks, wet
    Meadows, and damp Grounds.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

  <p id="section_263">263. In the variable Latitudes on the Atlantic Ocean; <em>cool fresh</em>
    Air is supplied from above, by descending Vortices of Wind and Showers:
    i.&nbsp;e. <em>Storms</em> of <em class="smcap">collection</em>.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"
    class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

  <p id="section_264">264. It may be remarked, in Confirmation of the above Doctrine,
    that triangular or Latteen Sails are used, and more useful, in a
    Mediterranean Sea, surrounded by high Lands, from which the Wind
    suddenly descends in Squalls; than in the open Atlantic, where the Wind
    is more equal.</p>

  <p>264. 2. Perhaps there cannot be a better Account of the depressing
    Torrent of Air, than that which Bacon has given, in describing the
    Motion of Wind on the Sails of Ships, in a <em>Squall</em>.</p>

  <p>“All Wind acting on the Sails of a Vessel, tends to depress or sink it.
    Wherefore <em>in strong Gales</em>, they first haul down the Yards, and
    take in the Topsails: afterwards all the Sails: cut away the Masts:
    throw the Lading overboard, the Guns, &amp;c. to lighten the Vessel, and
    keep her above Water.”&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Torrents of Air on <em>Etna</em>, and <em>Teneriffe</em>.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_265">Section 265.</span> WITH Respect to Mountains: on reading what Travellers have
    written, particularly Ullòa;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> they seem to answer
    the Intention of supplying cool Air to the surrounding Plains, or Continents; by
    Depression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> and Condensation: and also, if on Islands; to the Sea itself.</p>

  <p id="section_266">266. Brydone, in his Tour throu’ Sicily and Malta, in 1773;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"
    class="fnanchor">[75]</a> giving an Account of his Ascent to the Top of Etna, says, that at the Foot of
    the Crater, the Snow was frozen hard and solid:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and
    that the Crater
    was so hot; it was impossible to descend into it.</p>

  <p>Further: “that the Smoke rolled down from the Sides, like a Torrent:
    till of equal Gravity with the Air, when it shot off horizontally;
    forming a long Track, according to the Direction of the <em>Wind</em>:
    which there rose to a <em class="smcap">violent</em> Degree: so that it was with
    Difficulty he coud settle the Barometer for an Observation.”</p>

  <p>He also adds “that <em>Clouds</em> began to <em>gather</em> round the
    <em>Mountain</em>; but were <em>dispelled</em> by the Wind.”</p>

  <p>Now from the foregoing Theory is it not probable to suppose, that
    a <em>Torrent of Air rushed</em> continually down from the etherial
    Regions, not only to supply the Fire of the Crater; but also the
    Vacuity caused by the perpetual Elevation of Vapours and heated Air
    from below: the Torrent likewise <em>depressing</em> into the Track with
    itself, the Volumes of Smoke which were seen to roll directly down the
    Sides of the Mountain: that this descending Torrent of Air, in its
    Progress, dispelled the Clouds forming round the Sides of the Mountain,
    by the Ascent of warm Vapours condensing, as they rose, on their
    Approach to the cold Mountain: the Smoke shooting <em>horizontally</em>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>from that Height <em>only</em>, at which an <em>horizontal Current
    of Air</em> began to take Place? For it can hardly be imagined that the
    Air at the Top of Etna, found to be “<em>electrical</em>,” and which
    must have been replete with a Mixture of Floguiston, inflammable Air,
    Gasses, and other aërial Fluids highly rarefied, heated, <em class="smcap">dry</em>,
    (and consequently lighter,) <em>at the Instant</em> of rising out of the
    glowing Cauldron, became so condensed as to fall like Water, without
    partaking of the Motion of a <em>violent</em> Wind, supposed to blow in
    an horizontal Direction.</p>

  <p id="section_267">267. Glas, in his Account of Teneriffe,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> reports,
    that the Clouds are generally half as high as the Peak, above the Sea,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78"
    class="fnanchor">[78]</a> i.&nbsp;e. according to him, near the Height of a Mile and Half: “<em>below</em>
    which Clouds, the <em>North Easterly Winds</em> <em class="smcap">generally</em>
    prevail: and, at the same Time, <em>above them</em>, we find a <em>fresh
    Westerly</em> <em class="smcap">Gale</em>: which I believe to be the Case <em>in every
    Part of the World when the</em> <em class="smcap">trade wind</em> blows.”</p>

  <p>In Page 253, he says, that in ascending above the Level of the Clouds,
    he found the Air sharp, cold and piercing: and the Wind blew strong
    from South West, and West South West: so that the Wind blew towards the
    Mountain from three different Points at least, viz. the Trade Wind,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>from North East below the Clouds; just above them, from South
    West: and still higher, a fresh Gale, from West.</p>

  <p>“The Air on the Top of the Pike was thin, cold, piercing; and of a dry
    parching Nature, like the South Easterly Winds which I have felt in the
    great Desert of Africa, or the Levanters in the Mediterranean: or even
    not unlike those dry easterly Winds which are frequent in the Northern
    Parts of Europe, in clear Weather, in the Months of March or April,”
    Page 257.</p>

  <p>This dry Wind answers to the Eknèfiai (before mentioned) i.&nbsp;e. <em>Wind
    descending</em> <em class="smcap">from the clouds</em>.</p>

  <p>Glas further observes (Page 250) that the Clouds, in fine Weather,
    descend gradually towards Evening, and rest on the Woods till Morning:
    when they re-ascend, and remain suspended above them, till the
    succeeding Evening.</p>

  <p>Here then a nocturnal Depression of the Atmosphere is obvious. But
    this Appearance will not prove that the Air does not descend below
    the Level of the Clouds: for, tho’ the Clouds descend with the Air;
    Vapour-Air, of which they are composed, becomes <em>transparent</em> both
    by Dissolution, in a warmer Stratum, and Proximity to the Earth, as
    before mentioned.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Conclusion drawn from the above, applicable to Balloons.</div>

  <p id="section_268">268. From the Variety of Winds experienced at different Heights, not
    only on <em>Teneriffe</em>, but in different Places; it is plain, that if

    the Tropics by an East or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> West Current at Pleasure: and also

  <h3>CORROBORATING PROOFS OF A DEPRESSION.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft">Sect. 268. Art. 1.&nbsp;</span>THE Author is well informed, that, during an
    Engagement at Sea;—in <em>ten</em> Minutes after the Action has
    commenced;—tho’ it blew a <em>Gale</em> before; (that is, tho’ it blew
    <em>violently</em>;) the Agitation of the Air, arising from the Explosion
    of the <em>great Guns</em>, and small Arms, woud counteract the Wind, and
    produce a dead Calm.</p>

  <p>268. 2. Quere: does not the <em>new elastic</em> Air, produced from the
    Nitre,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> give an instantaneous Compression and
    Dilatation to the <em>incumbent</em> atmospheric Air, round the Place of Action, while
    the <em>lighter floguisticated Air</em> passes throu’ it, raising, and
    affecting to its highest Limit, the <em>whole</em> Atmosphere. And
    does not the Effect of a sudden Calm, suppose the Wind to <em>descend
    from above</em> with a Kind of <em>saltatory</em> Motion, instantly
    counteracted by the <em>new elastic</em> Air?—For if the Wind be supposed
    to blow sideways or horizontally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> <em>to any considerable Height
    above</em> the Water, woud not the fresh <em>lateral</em> Air glide away,
    and prevent the Continuance of the Calm?</p>

  <p id="section_269">269. When a Squall happens, or only Rain falls; Air will <em>rush</em>
    from all Sides, and from <em>above</em>, to supply the Vacancy of the
    fallen Cloud and Vapour.</p>

  <p>The Air immediately <em>above</em> must fall: the lateral Air gravitating
    towards other Places. Hence <em>Cold</em>, and a bright Sky after Rain.</p>

  <p id="section_270">270. The Theory of Accumulation may account for the frequent
    <em>warm</em> Rains in Winter, and during the Night.</p>

  <p>For the preceding diurnal Accumulation over the Sea, may
    <em>circulate</em> during the Night, at a great Altitude, to restore
    the Equilibrium and Loss of <em>cold</em> Land Air sent by a low
    or Ground-Wind to Sea, during the Day-Time: particularly, as
    the <em>Accumulation</em> over the Sea, during Winter, is almost
    <em>continual</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_271">271. The <em>Wind</em> would more frequently be perceived to
    <em>descend</em> and <em>rebound upwards</em>, (Trials of which might be
    made by holding an Umbrella, extended at right Angles with its Axis,
    upright in the Hand;) if the same Opportunity offered, of opposing as
    great a Surface to it in a perpendicular, as is every Day done, in an
    horizontal Direction: for in walking, the whole Height of the Body, and
    half its Surface, is opposed horizontally to the Wind: but the Head
    only, which is covered, is opposed to the perpendicular Pressure.</p>

  <p id="section_272">272. As every Circumstance in the Order of Nature is so admirably
    contrived that each apparent Inconvenience rectifies itself; in
    <em>heavy</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> Winds continuing to blow from a <span
    class="smcap">cold</span> Point; the
    Construction of the Atmosphere is such, that the <em>warm light</em> Air
    from the opposite Points will necessarily rise up and flow over the
    cold Stratum, and by their Tendency to an Equilibrium, will produce an
    Air <em>less cold</em>, before the <em>same</em> Wind is exhausted.</p>

  <p id="section_273">273. On the one Hand; it is probable, that, as cold Winds are heavy;
    the Eknèfiai Winds are covered with frequent Waves of the Apogay, or
    light warm Air rolling over them, frequently from the opposite Points.</p>

  <p id="section_274">274. On the other Hand, as the <em>Apogay</em> Winds are naturally light
    and warm, it is <em>improbable</em> that they shoud be <em>frequently</em>
    covered with Waves of <em>cold heavy Air</em>, rolling over them from
    Eknèfiai Points.</p>

  <p>It may therefore be reasonably concluded, that the Eknèfiai Winds, when
    approaching or opposed to the Apogay, shoud be considered as <em>Ground
    Winds</em>, (i.&nbsp;e. Winds blowing next the Surface of the Earth, tho’ they
    be supposed at the same Time to descend) which receive the Apogay above
    them: and that the Apogay being warm light and <em class="smcap">moist</em>, (which
    last will have the same Effect, as if they were more elastic;)&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"
    class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
    being also more turbulent, and endued with greater Velocity, press back
    the Eknèfiai from the Surface of the Earth, and upwards; and at the
    same Time flow above them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

  <p>By which means the Eknèfiai partake of their Qualities;—become less

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_275">Section 275.</span> IF then this Reasoning be allowed; aërial Travellers will
    not be subject, when, at a considerable Height, even in Winter, to
    great Degrees of Cold, supposing that the Air does not actually freeze
    the Waters below; and the Apogay or Southerly Winds have continued for
    a few Days.</p>

  <p>On the Contrary; Aironauts may expect Cold, encreasing with their
    Ascent, even in Summer, tho’ <em>warm</em> below; supposing the Eknèfiai
    or Northerly Winds to have continued but for a Day before the Ascent:
    they may possibly, indeed by soaring higher, rise into the regular
    Stratum of the warm Apogay floating above them.</p>

  <p id="section_276">276. From what has been said, there seems a Degree of Probability, that
    the Air for a Number of Miles, <em>above warm cultivated Plains</em>
    shoud differ materially in its Temperature, from Air above Mountains,
    or <em>even on a Level</em> with their Summits.</p>

  <p>That the former Air, in moderate Weather, shoud continue <em>warm and
    rarefied</em>: while the latter is <em>cool and condensed</em>.</p>

  <p>For the same Reason the Air over the Sea, on the Hours of Accumulation;
    i.&nbsp;e. during the Night, in Summer, and frequently in Winter, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>shoud
    be found <em>warm</em> and <em>rarefied</em>: especially during a Continuance
    of the Apogay Winds.</p>

  <p id="section_277">277. It is likewise probable that the Atmosphere will be found
    <em class="smcap">respirable</em> at much greater Heights, than is at present
    imagined: during the Continuance of the Eknèfiai Winds; and also, on
    Account of the <em>defloguisticated</em> Air,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> which
    is <em>drier</em> and <em>less elastic</em> in Proportion to its Rarity.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84"
    class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

  <p id="section_278">278. The Height of 10 Miles seems not too great to limit human
    Respiration, shoud any Attempt be made, to soar with a Balloon in a
    mild Atmosphere; and particularly between the Tropics.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"
    class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

  <p>But an Objection woud be found in the Size of a Balloon sufficiently
    capacious to contain nearly 6 Times the Bulk to which the Gass woud
    necessarily expand itself, at the Height of 10 Miles.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">First Cause of Limitation, in the Ascent of Balloons.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Second Cause of Limitation in the Ascent of Balloons.</div>

  <p id="section_279">279. It seems most likely that the primary Cause that will affect the
    Ascent of Balloons is the Difficulty of encreasing the Dimension of the
    Balloon: the Second, is from the excessive Cold; if the Wind blows from
    any Points of the North.</p>

  <p>Supposing the Construction of the Atmosphere to be as represented by
    different Authors, (which, by the Way, is scarcely credible) ten Miles
    will perhaps be the utmost attainable Height.</p>

  <p id="section_280">280. There is a Circumstance relative to the Motion of the Air, which
    has not been sufficiently attended to: and bears some Analogy with that
    of a <em>Thorough Air</em>.</p>

  <p>This Circumstance may not improperly be called the <em>Reception</em> and
    <em>Dispersion of Air</em>.</p>

  <p>In cold Climates, it is an Object of Dread: in warm ones, a most
    desirable Piece of Luxury.</p>

  <p>A gentle Undulation of the Air is perceived in Peru, and other hot
    Climates, by Persons sitting in <em>Arbours</em> sheltered from the Sun.</p>

  <p>The surrounding Air is instantly <em>contracted</em> by
    <em>Condensation</em>, during the Absence of the Sun’s Rays, and
    therefore occupies a <em>less Space</em>: <em>fresh Air</em> is
    <em>received</em>, and as instantly <em>dispersed</em> by Expansion
    towards those Parts, which are the warmest, i.&nbsp;e. where there is
    least Resistance: so that a gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> Breeze is constantly kept up,
    <em>probably</em> by a Depression from <em>above</em>.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

  <p id="section_281">281. Analagous to this, are those Winds which generally <em>rise
    early</em> and die away at <em>Sunset</em>: the nocturnal Condensation of
    the Air being sufficient for the <em class="smcap">reception</em>: as Air suffers
    some Compression without Tumult.</p>

  <p>To demonstrate the Changes owing also to remote and invisible Causes
    least suspected; Boyle somewhere speaks of an Instrument he made, which
    was so nicely contrived, that he coud tell, while sitting in his own
    Apartment, whenever any detached Cloud passed beneath the Sun’s Disk.
    The Principle on which it acted seems to have been that of a Reception
    and Dispersion of Air that took Place within <em>the</em> <em class="smcap">shadow</em>
    proceeding from the Cloud.</p>

  <p id="section_282">282. An oblique Argument supporting the Doctrine of Depression,
    asserted to take Place, in fair Weather, is that <em>Wind</em> drys up
    the Moisture from the Ground more than the <em>Sun</em>: and that March
    which is the <em>windiest</em>, is also the <em>most drying</em>, tho’
    <em>not</em> the <em>hottest</em> Month.</p>

  <p>Bacon, in his Enquiry into Motions and Undulations of the Air, uses a
    Metaphor, which tho’ somewhat facetious, is strictly philosophical.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87"
    class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
    “<em>For when</em> <em class="smcap">winds</em> <em>lead</em> <em class="smcap">the dance</em>, <em>it
    woud be agreeable to know the</em> <em class="smcap">figure</em>.”&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
    class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

  <p>And it is probable, that they really press the Earth with a saltatory
    progressive undulating Motion, <em>descending</em> in elastic Steps of
    sudden Compression; and <em>rising</em> with quick alternate ones, of
    Dilatation and Expansion.</p>

  <p>Dicker’s Balloon gave Proof of this.</p>

  <p id="section_283">283. Lastly: the <em class="smcap">chill</em> <em>of Air</em> which always takes
    Place over <em class="smcap">water</em>, and <em>moist</em> Grounds, even in the
    <em class="smcap">finest weather</em>, strongly favours the <em>Reception</em> and
    <em>Dispersion</em> of <em>it</em>, to the surrounding and more heated
    Lands: (which can only be supplied, as before mentioned, by Torrents
    of fresh Air <em>gradually descending</em> from the etherial or middle
    Region of the Atmosphere;) and seems to produce the same Effect, viz.
    a constant Breeze, with that of the Arbor, Shade, or Shelter from the
    <em>Sun</em>: also with that of the <em>Shadow</em> from the Cloud passing
    under his Disk, which affected a complete Thermometer and Hygrometer.</p>

  <p id="section_284">284. On a Change of Weather from Frost to Thaw, the Colour of the
    <em>upper Air</em> <em class="smcap">first</em> alters from a <em>clear and deep</em>, to
    a <em>dull and faint</em> Blue, or to a muddy Haze, not distinguishable
    into Clouds, but visible above them; a vivid Brightness still
    remaining, for many Hours, to about 500 Yards above the Surface of the Earth.</p>

  <p>Or, soft <em>warm</em> Showers fall gently, without Wind, or any apparent
    Change in its Direction.</p>

  <p>All which seem to favour the Accumulation and Descent of <em>warm
    Air</em>, by Waves of the Apogay rolling over the Eknèfiai Winds.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><em>Proper</em> Days in the Month for the Ascent of Balloons.</div>

  <p class="drop-capa"><span class="pleft" id="section_285">Section 285.</span>AS the <em>safest Hour</em> of the Day has been already
    pointed out, for the Ascent of those Aironauts, who propose to cross a
    Channel, or Arm of the Sea, in a Balloon <em>Air-tight</em> or nearly so:
    it may not be useless to throw out a few Hints on the properest Days in
    <em>each Month</em>, for the Ascent of Balloons.</p>

  <p id="section_286">286. It will perhaps be found true, that the more frequent Winds are
    generated near the Surface of the Earth: but that <em>Storms</em> are
    generated from above. Cold, Heat, Drought, and Moisture produce the
    more frequent and diurnal Winds: but the Conjunctions and Operations of
    the Moon and Planets contribute to the Production of Storms and other
    Inequalities of the Atmosphere: more especially the <em>Moon</em>: at the
    New and Full. These Attractions first affect the <em>superior Parts</em>
    of the Atmosphere.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

  <p id="section_287">287. “We are sure in the calmest Weather, to have some Breeze at Noon,
    and at full Tide.” Therefore, both are improper Times for Balloons to
    be at Sea: the Time of low Water and Midnight woud be best in those, if
    equal in other Respects.</p>

  <p>Changes of Weather as to Wind or Calm happen about the New and Full
    Moon.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

  <p id="section_288">288. Varieties of Tide produced by the united or divided Forces of the
    Sun and Moon, occasion similar Changes in the Atmosphere nearly at the
    same Time.</p>

  <p>For Instance, at the Time of the New Moon or Conjunction, i.&nbsp;e. when
    the Earth, Moon, and Sun, are <em>nearly</em> in a Line; the Moon being
    between them: also at the Time of the Full Moon; i.&nbsp;e. when the Moon,
    Earth, and Sun are <em>nearly</em> in a Line; and the Earth between them,
    which is called the Opposition.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

  <p>In the first Case, the Moon and Sun attract the Atmosphere of the Earth
    conjointly, or with united Force: in the second Case; the Earth being
    between them, they act in Opposition to each other, still nearly in the
    same Line.</p>

  <p>At these Times, the <em class="smcap">spring</em> <em>Tides</em> are at the
    <em>highest</em> i.&nbsp;e. once every Fortnight; and in the two interval Weeks
    are the <em class="smcap">neap</em> or <em>lowest</em> Tides: for a like Reason.</p>

  <p>Because, in the latter Case, a Line supposed to be drawn from the Moon
    to the Earth, and another from the Earth to the Sun, woud form nearly a
    right Angle: or in other Words; because the Moon and Sun woud attract
    the Earth at right Angles to each other, or in a lateral Direction:—the
    Moon woud draw one Way and the Sun another:—their Forces woud be divided.</p>

  <p>Now it is a Fact, that the Ocean is raised considerably twice every
    twenty-five Hours, by the Attraction of the Moon, when she comes to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>the Meridian. So that the Surface of the Sea, instead of putting
    on the Form of a Sphere, or Globe, will be changed into an <em>oval</em>
    Figure, whose longest Diameter being produced, woud pass throu’ the
    Moon.</p>

  <p>In like Manner a similar Elevation must take Place, as often as the Sun
    is in the Meridian; either above or below the Horizon.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this Elevation is <em>greatest</em> on the New and Full Moon,
    because the Moon and Sun do then conspire in their Attractions: and
    <em>least</em> in the Quarters: as they will then draw different Ways;
    the <em>Difference</em> of their Actions only producing an Effect.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Intumescence will be of a <em>middle</em> Degree, at the
    Times between the Quarters, and New and Full Moon.</p>

  <p id="section_289">289. As in the Ocean, so in the Air above it; a Tide of Air must roll
    along the Atmosphere, throu’ the whole Extent of it; and rise upwards
    twice in about 24 Hours.</p>

  <p>And since the Height of the Atmosphere is computed by Halley at 45
    Miles, and the Depth of the Ocean at an Average, but half a Mile; the
    Air will more easily and quickly obey the Attraction of the Moon and
    Sun, than the Tide of the Ocean: and, as it revolves in a Sphere which
    is about 100 Times larger than that of the Ocean, the Agitation and the
    Velocity of its Tide, will be something greater, in Proportion to its
    Elasticity, and inferior Density to the Water of the Ocean.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"
    class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

  <p id="section_290">290. The <em>Weight</em> of the Air must now be considered.</p>

  <p>The Weight of the Atmosphere in England does not exceed 31&#x200B;1⁄2 Inches
    of Mercury in the Barometer: nor does the least Weight fall short
    of 28&#x200B;1⁄2: the greatest Difference in the Weights may be taken at 2
    Inches: dividing 30 (nearly equal to the whole Weight) by 2, the Answer
    is 15. So that the under Parts of the Atmosphere being pressed upon by
    about a fifteenth Part less Weight at one Time, than at another; the
    <em>specific Gravity</em> of the Air will sometimes be a fifteenth Part
    lighter.</p>

  <p>But the Height of the Atmosphere being estimated at 45 Miles, which is
    equipoised by about 30 Inches; when equipoised by a fifteenth Part less
    Weight; (that is, dividing 45 Miles by 15; which amounts to the same as
    if a fifteenth Part of the whole Height was taken away; the Answer is
    3 Miles;) shews that the Atmosphere is 3 Miles higher at one Time than
    at another, over certain Places; indicated by the Barometer at those
    Places.</p>

  <p>Such an Accumulation of Air, arising only from Pressure or specific
    Gravity in one Part of the Atmosphere, and not in another; by its
    Tendency to an Equilibrium; and when to this Tendency is added
    its <em>elastic</em> Force;—must be productive of <em class="smcap">winds</em>,
    <em>descending Torrents</em>, Inundations of Air, or Storms, near the
    Surface of the Earth: and nearly such a Difference in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>Barometer
    has been known to happen in a few Hours.</p>

  <p>Such Accumulation, however, is not properly <em>the Tide of Air</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_291">291. At the New and Full Moon, the united Attractions of the Moon and
    Sun raise the Spring Tides in the Ocean to the average Height of 10
    Feet and a half.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

  <p>And in the Moon’s Quarters, the Moon drawing one Way, while the Sun
    draws another, viz. at a right Angle, made by Lines from the Sun and
    Moon to the Earth’s Center; the average Height of the Neap Tides in the
    Ocean will be 6 Feet 7 Inches.</p>

  <p>The same Attraction which raises Water 10 Feet and a half, will raise
    Air, whose Density is 800 Times less, to almost one third of that to
    which the whole Pressure of the Atmosphere can raise Fluids:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"
    class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Now it
    has been before seen, that the Pressure of the Atmosphere raised the
    Air 45 Miles: so that the Air is raised by the united Actions of the
    Moon and Sun, at the New and Full Moon, to one-third Part of 45; i.&nbsp;e.
    to 15 Miles. And for the same Reason, the Air is raised at the Moon’s
    Quarters to 10 Miles:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> the Difference between which
    is 5 Miles.</p>

  <p>There is consequently a real <em>Tide of Air</em> five Miles higher
    at each New and Full Moon, than at her Quarters: which Tide rolls
    with incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> Velocity along the Verge or highest Limit of the
    Atmosphere; and is generally productive of Wind below.</p>

  <p id="section_292">292. The Elasticity of the Air must likewise be brought into the
    Account, as contributing greatly to its Motion: the Spring of Air
    always increasing as the Pressure encreases.</p>

  <p>Considerable Changes must therefore ensue in the inferior Parts of the
    Atmosphere.</p>

  <p>For as the Effect of the Moon’s Attraction is to diminish the Weight
    of the Atmosphere (tho’ its Quantity be increased) by elevating the
    Column of Air in the Line of her Meridian; the Rarefaction of the Air
    is therefore encreased, first <em>at the Top</em> of the Atmosphere;
    afterwards it gradually descends to the Bottom, or Surface of the
    Earth: so that the incumbent Weight being diminished, the Air beneath
    will be greatly <em>expanded</em>.</p>

  <p>At whatever Height therefore any <em>Quantity of Vapour</em> or superior
    Cloud <em>rested</em>, while the Moon was in her Quarter; it woud
    <em>gradually descend</em> at the Approach of the next New or Full: at
    which Times it woud remain suspended at a Height, where an Expansion
    took Place equivalent to the former Expansion, at the Moon’s Quarter:
    and, if the Height during the Moon’s Quarter was only equal to
    that of common Clouds; such Vapour woud, at the New and Full Moon,
    <em>descend</em> in Mist, Rain, Snow, or Wind.</p>

  <p id="section_293">293. Little Reliance is to be placed, in these <em>Northern</em>
    Climates, on the aggregate Weight (<em>or elastic Power</em>) of the Air,
    indicated by the Height of the Barometer, near the Times of the New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
    and Full Moons: tho’, in general, it will <em>descend</em> about those
    Times.</p>

  <p>These Things being so; it woud be improvident to undertake an aërial
    Excursion, either three Days before, or three Days after the Day,
    either of the New, or Full Moon: the Ascent shoud be forborne every
    other Week; at least till the Art<span class="sidenote">Proper Days for Ascent.</span> is a little more advanced.</p>

  <p>The two remaining alternate Weeks in each Month, viz. when the Moon is
    in the Quarters, and the Tide of Air flowing throu’ the Atmosphere, is
    checked, counterbalanced, and equalized, by the lateral Attractions
    of the Moon and Sun, acting at right Angles, i.&nbsp;e. on different Parts
    of the Air, pendent on the Earth’s Surface;—more settled and regular
    Weather may be naturally expected; and particularly freer from the
    Extremes of <em>Wind</em> and <em>Cold</em>.</p>

  <p>Moreover, as the Almanack, and Ephèmeris&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> may be
    always consulted;
    the Day fixed on shoud not be <em>marked</em> with Conjunctions of
    the Planets.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The Inequality of their united
    Attractions greatly
    deranges the Equilibrium of the upper Parts of the Atmosphere;
    producing sudden Squalls and Gusts of Wind: which, tho’ of short
    Continuance, perhaps a few Hours, are inauspicious to the successful
    Inflation and Ascent of a Balloon, during the Infancy of the Science.

  <p>1. First, lest the Balloon shoud rise too <em>high</em>; for by opening
    the Valve in order to descend; Gass escapes: which is an <em>actual

  <p>If <em>Sand</em> be the Ballast fixed on; put as much of it into a

    Thong; the Ends of which may be left a few Inches to <em>spare</em>.</p>

  <p>The Grapple may remain in the Car.</p>

  <p>294. 3. When the Balloon <em>begins</em> to descend over Water; lower out
    the Cable, by Degrees.</p>

  <p>Tye a Pair of Bladders, one of which contains Ballast, very tight,
    round the End of the Cable.</p>

  <p>Then a second Pair, at such a Distance that the intermediate Part of
    the Cable, will <em>float</em>.</p>

  <p>Repeat this Process, till the proper Effect is obtained; or the whole
    Ballast is discharged.</p>

  <p>294. 4. The Car and Balloon may be <em>hauled</em> or wound <em>down</em>
    to the Surface of the Water: and the Ballast resumed, as the Balloon
    approaches the Shore.</p>

  <p>294. 5. If it be found necessary, the Ballast may be <em>discharged</em>
    by cutting the <em class="smcap">thongs</em>, <em>gradually</em>: or the
    <em class="smcap">cable</em>, <em>at once</em>.</p>

  <p>294. 6. If the Wind be <em>contrary</em>, and the Weather
    <em>moderate</em>; the Tide, or Stream may, by <em>Calculation</em> and
    <em>Foresight</em>, be made to serve the Purpose of the Aironaut, in
    towing the Ballast which floats on its Surface: and thus checking, or
    gently drawing the Balloon after it.</p>

  <p>294. 7. In such Cases, the Aironaut woud do well in applying his
    <em>propulsive</em> Machinery.</p>

  <h3>A GENERAL OBSERVATION.</h3>

  <p>294. 8. To prevent the car of the <em>Balloon</em> from being drawn out
    of the Perpendicular, a Circumstance not infrequent; it is necessary
    to have some Contrivance, by which the Cable shall run throu’ a
    moveable Pulley, on a Swivel, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> the Center above the Car; and
    that the Aironaut shall be able <em>instantly</em>, by a Screw, or otherways,
    to fasten the Pulley and Cable so tight, that the Stress shall remain
    on the Center above the Car, however <em>forcibly</em> the Cable may be
    stretched.</p>

  <h3>ANOTHER METHOD OF SUSTAINING A BALLOON OVER WATER, WITHOUT LOSS OF GASS, OR OF BALLAST.</h3>

  <p class="drop-capa"><span class="pleft" id="section_295">Section 295.</span> Let the Ballast consist of that Kind of Rope (wound on
    a Reel) that is either by Nature or Art, <em>specifically</em> lighter
    than fresh Water: as a <em>hollow cylindrical</em> Rope of Silk, in
    which Corks are thrust: the Silk to be dipped into elastic Varnish, to
    prevent the Absorption of Water into the Pores: or a common Rope well
    varnished; or covered over with a cylindric Case of varnished Silk,
    might answer the same Intention, if Corks or Bladders were tyed at
    proper Distances: in which Case, the Rope might, at the first Ascent of
    the Balloon, hang from the Center above the Car, at its full Extent,
    suppose a Mile or a Mile and half in Length, without the Encumbrance of a Reel.</p>

  <p>If Bladders are used; those that hang near the Car shoud not be more
    than <em>half blown</em>.</p>

  <p>By the above Expedient; as soon as the Balloon began to decline,
    from Evaporation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> Gass, or Depression of the Atmosphere, and
    the lowest Part of the Rope touched the Water; the Balloon woud continue
    to levitate, in Proportion to the Quantity of Rope sustained on the
    Surface of the Water.</p>

  <p>The Aironaut woud move less <em>swift</em> indeed, but more conveniently;
    as he woud not be obliged to rise <em>above</em> the Wind: but be able to
    <em>lower</em>, and <em>raise</em> himself at Pleasure: <em>first</em>, by
    pulling up a Part of the Rope into the Car; and having there <em>made it
    fast</em>;</p>

  <p><em>Secondly</em>, by cutting away, as he saw Occasion, the loose End,
    and Folds of the Rope so drawn into the Car with him.</p>

  <h3 class="hang">ON THE NECESSITY OF ASCERTAINING THE PROPER MODES OF DIRECTION, BY
    DIFFERENT AND FREQUENT EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">On the Necessity of frequent Experiments, in different Modes
    of Direction.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_296">Section 296.</span> THE Necessity of making frequent Experiments, in order
    to prove how far the Balloon is capable of Direction, by different
    Combinations of the mechanical Powers, is so apparent; that no Balloon
    shoud rise a second Time, without the Application of Machinery to that End.</p>

  <p>Each Candidate for Fame, as Proprietor of a Balloon for <em>public
    Exhibition</em>, ought to vie in his Pretensions to a Superiority of
    Manouvres.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

  <p>Their respective Performances woud appear in the public Papers; and
    Decisions be made to the Advantage of the Art.</p>

  <p>For it is probable, that by such <em>Comparison</em> chiefly;—the
    <em class="smcap">comparison</em> of <em>experimental Blunders</em> and
    <em>Mistakes</em>, and not by an Union of Theory and Practice,
    cemented by liberal Patronage, the Balloon can arrive to any
    Degree of Perfection, in a Country, which is the Scene of
    <em>perpetual Contention</em>: where the Sum of Life seems devoted
    but to <em class="smcap">party</em>; and where the <em>precious</em> Time of the
    <em class="smcap">great</em> is sunk in Luxury, and their <em>exalted</em> Talents lost
    in the <em>Labyrinth</em> of Politics.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Precautions to secure a Landing.</div>

  <p id="section_297">297. <em>To strive against the Stream</em> is proverbially impossible:
    and it woud be literally so, to attempt by any Kind of Machinery to
    force the large Surface of a Balloon, with any Degree of Velocity,
    against <em>a Stream of</em> <em class="smcap">air</em>. (<a href="#section_201">Section 201</a>.)</p>

  <p>Ships, which have the Aid of an Element 800 Times <em>denser</em> than
    the <em class="smcap">air</em>, are obliged to wait <em>in Port</em>, till the Wind
    is favourable. But neither is this considered as an Argument against
    <em>maritime Navigation</em>: nor does the <em>Perfection</em> of the
    Balloon require its Ascent in a Storm: tho’ the Preference due to the
    Balloon, on such Occasion, woud be decisive in its Favour: as the
    latter woud presently surmount the Wind, and <em>lie to</em>, in the
    <em>calm Air above</em> it.</p>

  <p id="section_298">Sect. 298. Art. 1. By Wings, or some propulsive Machinery, acting
    forcibly in a Direction required, and with Ease to the <em>Operator</em>;
    <em class="smcap">two</em> <em>useful Manouvres</em> may be attempted, and will

  <div class="sidenote"><em>First Manouvre</em>: to secure the Landing in windy
    Weather.</div>

  <p>298. Art. 2. First, To <em class="smcap">retard</em> the Course of the Balloon
    during its Descent; in such a Manner, as to prevent the Wind from
    <em>damaging</em> the <em>Machine</em>, or <em>snapping the Cable</em>:
    and thus to land with Safety, and at the <em>smallest Distance</em>
    <em class="smcap">beyond</em> the Place assigned.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Preparatory Apparatus: and <em>Signal-Rope</em>.</div>

  <p>298. 3. A <em>silken</em>, or other <em>light</em> Rope is to be provided:
    and to run throu’ a <em>snatch Block</em> fastened to a <em class="smcap">rudder</em>,
    or to the <em class="smcap">car</em>, as in Crosbie’s Balloon.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"
    class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

  <p>Which Rope <em>alone</em> woud lessen immediate and unforeseen Danger, by
    using the Balloon as a Sail, if it actually alighted on the Water.</p>

  <p>298. Art. 4. The same Rope being <em>a Mile</em>, or <em>a Mile and
    Half</em> in Length; the <em>Whole</em>, or a Part of it, might
    be suffered to run off the Wheel, and, falling on the Surface
    <em>below</em>, in <em>misty</em> Weather, woud serve as a Signal to
    determine whether the Aironaut was over Land, or Water.</p>

  <p>Also by winding up his Wheel, he might, if the Weather was moderate,
    bring himself <em>down</em> to the Grapple, which might be so contrived
    as to <em>run down</em> the Rope, and remain at the Bottom, by Means of a
    Knot, or other Check.</p>

  <p>He might also <em>loose</em> his Grapple, and <em>rise</em> again: or when
    down; pull the Valve-Cord, and land.</p>

  <p>298. 5. With a <em class="smcap">second</em> short Cable, snatch Block and Grapple,
    he woud be able to <em>moor</em> the Balloon, from which, he might, by
    procuring the Country People to load the Car with fresh Ballast equal
    in Weight to himself;—get out, and even leave the Balloon in their Care.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

  <p>The Precaution of knowing whether he was over a fresh Water-Lake,
    (for he might hear the Sea) might be useful in misty and low cloudy
    Weather by Day, or during the Night; without expending Gass in the
    <em>exploratory</em> Descent.</p>

  <p>298. 6. To facilitate the landing, the <em>Signal-Rope</em> may be
    used to the greatest Advantage, particularly in windy Weather; by
    <em>lowering out</em> a Part, or the Whole, whether a Mile, or Mile
    and half, so that the Grapple may take Effect on the Ground, at the
    Distance of its Length <em>by Estimation</em>, <em>short</em> of the Place
    where the Balloon is intended to land.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Grapple <em>holds</em>; it is in the Option of the
    Aironaut, to tye Parcels of his Ballast <em>loosely</em> round the Cable,
    to run downwards along with it.</p>

  <p>(For <em>which Purpose</em>, Iron-Rings with <em>Spring-Swivels</em>, which
    <em>open</em> by <em>Pressure</em> of the Fingers, and <em>shut</em> of
    themselves, might answer better than the <em>leathern Thongs</em>, as the
    former might be put, in <em>an Instant</em>, round the Cable, and woud
    run down <em>quicker</em>.)</p>

  <p>These Parcels of Ballast are to be sent down, in Succession, till the
    Balloon has acquired such Degrees of <em class="smcap">false levity</em>, as will
    be sufficient to counteract that Tendency which the Wind will have to
    <em>depress</em> the Car of the Balloon forcibly on the Surface, so long
    as it is connected with the Grapple <em>on the Ground</em>.</p>

  <p>298. 7. When this Point is effected, the Balloon will remain suspended
    in the Air; and being acted upon by the Wind, will be pressed into a
    Direction approaching to an horizontal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> Line, in Proportion to the
    encreasing Power of the Wind.</p>

  <p>And here the Necessity of having the Cable fastened to a Center above
    the Car, in order to retain its Perpendicularity, is most evident.</p>

  <p>The Aironaut, in this Situation, may venture to wind up the Cable
    <em>gradually</em>, and descend, to the Grapple.</p>

  <p>298. 8. Secondly: When the different Currents of Air, have been
    tried by Descent and Ascent of the Pioneer-Balloon,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
    and found to be <em>all</em> unfavourable; the Aironaut is to <em>rise</em> still
    higher, into a Calm, pursue his Course horizontally in the <em class="smcap">blue
    serene</em>, by propulsive Machinery: estimating the Velocity, by the
    <em>evident Resistance</em> of the half Mile white Flag described in
    Section 12, 13. and 12, 15. hanging at a proper Distance <em>below</em>,
    and of that which hangs loosely at the Side of the Car, to shew a
    Change in the Direction of the Wind, (then made by a Resistance of
    the Air): or he may <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>judge o£ the Velocity and Direction, by the
    <em>Flight</em> of a <em>Feather</em>, repeatedly let loose at certain
    Intervals of Time.</p>

      REMAIN SUSPENDED IN EQUILIBRIO.</span>
  </h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_299">Section 299.</span> PREVIOUS to the Ascent, provide a Cord, which shall have
    sufficient Strength to support twice its own Weight, when so great a
    Quantity of it is <em>coiled</em> together, as, if extended, woud measure
    half a Mile or a Mile.</p>

  <p>Weigh the whole <em>Coil</em>, or any Number of Yards, so as to obtain
    the whole Weight.</p>

  <p>Mark the whole Length of the Cord, with different <em>coloured</em>
    Worsted, or otherways, at the Distance of every eight Yards: as a
    <em>sounding</em> Line.</p>

  <p>Note the Marks in a Pocket-Book.</p>

  <p>These Things being done; give the Balloon, by <em class="smcap">inflation</em>,
    a Power of Levity <em>at least</em> equal to the known Weight of the
    Cord: which may be easily obtained by throwing into the Car, already
    <em>ballasted</em> and prepared, a Weight equal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> the Aironaut,
    together with that of the <em>Cord</em>.</p>

  <p>The Cord must also, previous to the Ascent, be rolled upon a Reel,
    (made fast in the Ground) whose Diameter shoud be <em class="smcap">two</em> Feet:
    each Turn of the Wheel may be called two Yards.</p>

  <p>A Barometer with an attached Thermometer fixed in the same Frame, also
    a second or detached Thermometer placed at the Distance of a Yard from
    the Frame, shoud remain upon the Ground during the Inflation.</p>

  <p>The same Apparatus of Barometer with attached and detached Thermometer,
    shoud be suspended in the Car.</p>

  <p>The Instant the Balloon ascends, an Observer below is to note in a
    Book the <em>Point</em> at which the Quicksilver stands in each of the
    <em class="smcap">three</em> Tubes of the lower Apparatus, also the Time of Ascent:
    the Aironaut the same.</p>

  <p>The Rope is, previous to the Ascent, to be tyed to a Center above the
    Car: and as soon as the Balloon has elevated the Car 100 Yards; the
    Observations, as before, are to be set down below, and by the Aironaut:
    and repeated at the Height of each 100 Yards: a Drum to beat; during
    the Time each Observation <em>below</em> is <em>noting</em> down; and
    the Balloon not suffered to rise, till the Drum has ceased. By such
    repeated <em>Notice</em>, and <em>Silence</em>; the Aironaut will know the
    <em>exact Height</em>, at which the Balloon is checked in its Elevation:
    and the <em>exact Time</em> during which its Elevation is impeded.</p>

  <p>This Process is to continue, till the Rope is raised to its full Length.</p>

  <p>At which Instant a double-barrel Gun is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> be fired: the exact
    Time noted <em>below</em>: and the Time of hearing the Sound noted above.</p>

  <p>These Notes are to be compared at the Aironaut’s arrival on Earth.</p>

  <p id="section_300">300. For such <em>nice</em> Experiments the Aironaut shoud ascend half an
    Hour before <em class="smcap">sunrise</em>, or <em>Sunset</em>: and the Day chosen by
    the foregoing Rules.</p>

  <p>The Air must be <em class="smcap">quite calm</em>: but it is not necessary that it
    shoud be free from Clouds or Mist.</p>

  <p>When the Rope is at its full Extent, the Operator <em>below</em> is
    to shorten it, by winding down the Balloon, 100 Yards: the Signals
    <em>below</em>, being repeated, till the Balloon is arrived within 100
    Yards of the Ground.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">To estimate the Densities at different Heights.</div>

  <p id="section_301">301. While one Observer <em>below</em> is writing down the Observation to
    be made the Instant the Balloon has risen exactly 100 Yards; another
    Operator is to weigh, by Hand, with Spring Steel-Yards, the Force of
    Levity already acquired, which is to be noted down by a third Bystander.</p>

  <p>This Process is to be repeated at every 100 Yards.</p>

  <p>The Levity, it is true, will encrease as the Balloon rises, (probably
    in a geometric Progression;)&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> yet the Cord, by
    rising with the Balloon, will greatly check it: if, however, it prove <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>insufficient for
    that Purpose, and, lest the Cord shoud be in Danger of breaking;
    the Bottom of the Balloon must be opened, or the upper Valve drawn.</p>

  <p>If the <em>Cord</em>, <em>Rope</em>, or <em>Balancer</em>, be sufficiently
    strong; there will be no Necessity for the Aironaut to throw out
    Ballast occasionally; nor for the Observations in the former Part
    of this Section: the <em>Densities</em> will likewise be more easily
    determined, by the <em>Weights</em>; which shew the <em>Encrease</em>
    of Levity and Expansion of the Balloon, at each of the <em>given</em>

    Barometer, when at 24 Inches for Example, or as soon as he finds his
    Balloon sufficiently expanded, pull up the Rope over a Pulley; or, wind
    it upon a Reel of two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>Feet Diameter, within the Car; and continue
    to do so; till he finds that the Barometer begins to <em>rise</em>,
    (which is a Sign that the Balloon <em>descends</em>), by the additional
    <em>Weight</em> of the Balancer just brought into the Car: on which,
    by preconcerted Agreement, he may throw out a <em class="smcap">white</em> Flag,
    prepared to hang a Yard below the Car.</p>

  <p>On Sight of the Flag, the Person at the Reel <em>below</em> is to cut the
    Rope: which Rope, or a Part of it, is to be drawn into the Car.</p>

  <p>The Balloon will rise no higher; but remain in <em>Equilibrio</em> in the

  <h3>ON BAL
  LOONS. THEIR DEFECTS AND FARTHER IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_303">Section 303.</span> These Defects are best known from the History: a Detail
    of which is given to the World in an entertaining, elegant, and
    scientific Manner, by a celebrated Writer on other Subjects, <em>Mons.
    Faujas de Saint Fond</em>, in two Volumes, 12mo. for the two last Years,
    illustrated with Engravings by the best Masters.</p>

  <p>And he promises a Continuation, or annual Register of Experiments and
    Improvements.</p>

  <p>The Title of the Book is, <cite class="upright">“Description des Experiences de la Machine
    aërostatique, &amp;c. &amp;c.”</cite></p>

  <p id="section_304">304. Mr. Cavallo has favoured the British Nation with a cursory
    tho’ clear Account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> same, in his “History of Airostation:”
    a Continuation of which it were to be wished he woud likewise publish
    annually.</p>

  <p id="section_305">305. It might contribute greatly to the Improvement of the Art; if
    Mr. Faujas woud give Engravings on a large Scale, of the different
    Machinery, already used or invented to direct the Balloon, with their
    Proportions: particularly the <em class="smcap">moulinet</em> of <em>Blanchard</em>: as
    well as that lately tried by Messrs. Auban and Vallet; whose Machinery
    is still <em>more distinguished</em> and <em class="smcap">effectual</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_306">306. The Titles and Sizes of all useful Books written on the Subject,
    also the Places where they are to be had, might likewise be inserted,
    at the End of each <em>annual</em> Volume.</p>

  <p id="section_307">307. The principal Defects of the British Balloons are, in</p>

  <p>1. The Construction.</p>

  <p>2. Production of Gass.</p>

  <p>3. Mode of Direction, and</p>

  <p>4. Security of landing.</p>

  <p>First, Defects of the Construction are both in the Form, and
    Composition.</p>

  <p>The Form ought to be that of a <em class="smcap">right</em>&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
    <em>Cylinder</em>,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> by which the <em>Capacity</em> is
    doubled without encreasing the Resistance: ending above and below, each in a
    Hemisphere. A cylindrical Trunk, 2 Feet in Diameter, being added to
    convey the Gass <em>into</em> the Balloon; and suffer it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>to escape,
    when too much expanded in the etherial Regions.</p>

  <p>It shoud also be furnished with a Valve, at the Bottom, of equal
    Diameter with the Trunk: keeping itself Air-tight; and opening outwards
    by a <em>given</em> Resistance, (as that of ten Pounds Troy,) from the
    inside Gass.</p>

  <p>There must be an upper Valve as usual: occasionally to promote a
    <em>swift</em> Descent.</p>

  <p id="section_308">308. The Form will likewise continue to be defective, till an interior
    Balloon for common Air is adopted, according to the Plan laid down by
    the ingenious Mons. Meunier, lately appointed by the French Academy
    of Sciences at Paris, one of the Commissioners for the Improvement of
    Airostation.</p>

  <p>The Use of which interior Balloon by Compression of the surrounding
    Gass in the external Balloon, prevents, it is said, the Loss of Ballast
    and of Gass: two very considerable Advantages.</p>

  <p>For the actual Sum total of Gass not being diminished; the Balloon will
    continue longer in the Air, before an Escape of Gass, throu’ the Pores
    of the Silk, makes it descend.</p>

  <p>There will, on the same Account, be less Occasion to take in
    <em>meer</em> Ballast, for the Purpose of throwing it <em>overboard</em>,
    to prevent the Descent.</p>

  <p>Therefore an equal Weight of Articles necessary to remain in the Car,
    may be substituted in Place of the Ballast.</p>

  <p id="section_309">309. Art. 1. And, since it is next <em>to impossible</em>, the Atmosphere
    shoud continue for 24 Hours together, of the <em>same Density, Weight,
    and Temperature</em>; or, in short, without Motion;—the Aironaut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
    will have a Power of seeking, at <em>different</em> Heights, for that
    Current of Air, or <em>Wind</em>, which suits him best: or, in a very
    few Minutes, to rise above all Currents; become stationary, and <em>lie
    to</em> in the <em class="smcap">serene</em>, waiting for a <em>Wind</em>: which, as
    before mentioned, he may readily find, by lowering out a Mile of Twine,
    and his <em>white</em> Flag: attending to it, with a small perspective
    Glass, or Magnifier.</p>

  <p>309. 2. Another most <em>material</em> Advantage is to be able, in a
    <em>high Wind</em>, to chuse the Spot on which he proposes to alight: or
    wait for a favourable Opportunity to descend.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">To ascertain the Height of the Balloon by a Quadrant.</div>

  <p id="section_310">310. To compute the Height and Distance of the Balloon, by Means of a
    <em>white</em> Flag, or other <em>visible</em> Object, suspended from the
    Car, at a certain Distance below it.</p>

  <p>Let the Observer take the Altitude of the Car with a Quadrant: and also
    the Altitude of the Object or Flag.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp33">
    <img src="images/i_240.jpg" alt="">
  </figure>

  <p>Then by a Case in plain Trigonometry; if the Altitude of the Car be by
    the Quadrant 59° = HAC, the Altitude of the Object 55° = HAO, and the
    Length of the Line veered out be 200 Yards, or otherwise = CO.</p>

  <p>Then the Complement of HAO = AOH = 35°; and the Complement of the Angle
    HAC = ACH = 31°; and the Supplement of OAC + ACO = AOC = 145°.</p>

  <p>Then, CAO 4° : CO 200 :: AOC 145° : AC; and Radius : AC :: CAH 59° : CH
    1409<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span> Yards, the Height of the Balloon taken at the Time.</p>

  <p>Next, Radius : AC :: ACH 31° : AH 846 Yards, which is the horizontal
    Distance of the Place on the Earth from the Observer, over which the
    Balloon was then suspended.</p>

  <p>This Method finds the Height truer than the Barometer, and with fewer
    Circumstances of Confusion.</p>

  <p>And if the Balloon Art coud be perfected, so as to make them stationary
    at any Height; this Circumstance woud afford excellent Opportunities of
    proving the Heights by the Barometer: besides which, the Distance also
    has been obtained: a Point not before attempted.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

  <h3>OF THE AIR-BOTTLE BALLOON.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_311">Section 311.</span>TILL the Particulars of Meunier’s Invention are made
    public,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> an additional <em>Air-tight</em> Balloon,
    or Air Bottle, at least 15 Feet in Diameter, of a <em>globular</em> Form, appended
    below the Car, and furnished with a <em>Condenser</em>, to be worked
    by <em>pulling upwards</em>, or, as the Bellows of an Organ, by the
    alternate Motion of the Feet of the Aironaut, standing upright in the
    Car, may be used instead of the interior Balloon; to keep the <em>great
    Balloon</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>at a <em>given</em> Height: and consequently prevent
    the Aironaut <em>from rising too high</em>: to atchieve which Purpose,
    during the <em>first Ascent</em>; a Rope or Balancer may be used, a
    Mile and half long, fastened to the Car, and rising with the Balloon,
    (to <em>check</em> its Power of <em>Ascent</em>,) till an Equilibrium is
    produced: at which Instant, on Sight of the <em>white</em> Flag from
    the Car, the Balance-Rope is to be cut, by the Operator <em>below</em>.
    (<a href="#section_302">Section 302</a>.)</p>

  <p>If the Aironaut perceives by the Rise of the <em>Barometer</em>, that the
    Balloon descends; he may throw out a <em>little</em> Ballast, (perhaps a
    Pound or two), and then wind up his Balancer, or suffer it to remain at
    any Length, at his Option.</p>

  <p id="section_312">312. By keeping the Balloon at a given Height <em>only</em>; no Gass
    is expended in preventing the necessary Tendency of Balloons to a
    perpetual Elevation: also, during the self Descent of the Balloon; by
    opening the Air-Bottle, the Aironaut will supersede the Necessity of
    throwing out Ballast, for a Re-ascent.</p>

  <p id="section_313">313. The Air-Bottle-Balloon shoud be covered by a strong <em>light</em>
    Net, of a Dimension rather less than the Bottle, which will hinder it
    from bursting: the Resistence of the <em>condensed</em> Air within, being
    then chiefly on the Net, and but little on the Bottle.</p>

  <p>The Net may be made of Silk and Cotton Thread; lest the Meshes, by the
    Pressure of the Knots, shoud eat into the Bottle.</p>

  <h3>SUPERIORITY OF THE AIR-BOTTLE TO AN INTERIOR BALLOON.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_314">Section 314.</span> THE Air-Bottle can be attended with no Sort of Danger.
    For, if it burst; the only Effect is to raise the Balloon: which is
    made to descend, at Pleasure, by opening either the <em>lower</em> or
    upper Valve.</p>

  <p>Whereas an interior Balloon condensed with common Air, presses
    against the surrounding exterior Gass: and the Gass, against the
    <em class="smcap">inside</em> of the <em>great Balloon</em>, when the latter is in an
    elevated and rarefied Atmosphere; which Atmosphere, in Proportion to
    its Height, makes <em>less</em> Resistance to the <em>Outside</em> of the
    great Balloon: and thereby encreases its Tendency to a Rupture.</p>

  <p>By the Application of the Air-Bottle, which will be to a Balloon, what
    an Air-Bladder, or <em>Swim</em> is to a Fish; a concomitant Advantage is
    derivable.</p>

  <p>For the common Balloon and Air-Bottle, which may be called <em class="smcap">a double
    balloon</em>, will, in their <em>present imperfect</em> State, be able to
    remain a Day, or perhaps a Couple of Days in the Air: there being no
    Loss of Gass: unless by Evaporation, throu’ the Pores of the Silk.</p>

  <p>And this Advantage of <em>a double Balloon</em> may be effected with
    little <em class="smcap">expence</em> (except that of a complete Net) to the
    different Proprietors, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> may make alternate Voyages, with the
    Balloons <em>thus</em> united: one being inflated with Gass; the
    other occasionally with three or more Atmospheres of common Air
    <em>condensed</em>.</p>

  <h3>HINTS FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE BALLOON.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_315">Sect. 315. Art. 1.&nbsp;</span>IN the London Chronicle, from the 20th to the 22d
    of August, 1785, is a Letter from Bury, containing an Account of Mr.
    Poole’s Balloon, with the following Circumstance, viz. “It was found
    necessary, before the Balloon was liberated, to cut away the Wings,
    intended to act as Sails, which had been constructed by an ingenious
    Piedmontese, patronized by <em class="smcap">lord orford</em>, and which it was
    supposed, woud have contributed <em>to facilitate the Direction of
    the</em> Balloon, but were found <em>greatly to retard the Celerity</em>
    of its Motion.”</p>

  <p>Now if any Credit can be given to Newspaper Accounts, (that of the
    Beccles Balloon being an entire Fable,) it is to be lamented that the
    Wings were cut away for the Reason assigned: as it seems the only one
    that could properly be offered for applying them.</p>

  <p>315. 2. Balloons already rise like a Rocket, and press forward
    almost with the Celerity of the Wind: it is therefore evident, that
    these Celerities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> must be <em>greatly retarded</em>, in order <em>to
    facilitate the Direction</em>: and consequently that the Wings bid
    fair to have answered the Intention of their ingenious Projector. And
    why precipitately cut them away, before the Balloon was left to the
    Pleasure of the Winds? since no regular or safe Manouvres ought to have
    been attempted, till that Time.</p>

  <p>There appears to have been much the same Reason for rejecting the
    Piedmontese Wings, that there was for condemning the use of a
    Parashute, to which a Dog being appended was killed in the Descent:
    because the Parashute was not let loose at a sufficient Height, nor was
    it properly distended.</p>

  <p id="section_315_3">315. 3. It seems, that as the Wings had <em>greatly</em> <em class="smcap">impeded</em>
    the Balloon; a certain <em>Addition</em> to them might have <em>nearly</em>
    <em class="smcap">stopped</em> it in the Air.</p>

  <p>For the Balloon having once acquired an uniform Motion, by encreasing
    the Surface of the resisting Body, or Wings, the Balloon maybe retarded
    to a certain Point. But the Resistence encreasing woud raise the
    resisting&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Body above its Power of Action, and
    therefore, in Fact,
    lessen it; by which Means the Balloon woud continue to be propelled in
    the Direction of the Wind, with a Force equal to that Diminution.</p>

  <p>Suppose, for Instance, that, instead of the half Mile Flag, which
    evidently checked the progressive Motion of the Balloon (<a href="#section_70">Section 70</a>) a
    larger square Surface, of varnished Silk, or a triangular Latteen Sail
    (like the Αρτεμων of Le Roi&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>) <span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>was substituted, and kept stretched,
    by a hollow Cane, or Yard.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

  <p>315. 4. Also, that by Means of a Fan or small Oar, acting as a Rudder,
    to be folded and taken back into the Car at Pleasure, the Balloon was
    compelled to move with a given Side foremost; that the Sail was let
    down below the Car, by strong silken Cords fastened to each Angle;
    and lastly, that leaden Weights, (each weighing an Ounce Averdupoise
    when widely perforated, and put throu’ the Ends of each Cord before
    it is fastened to the Car), be let down to each Angle; occasionally
    encreasing the Weights (or Sail) in Proportion to the Wind; which
    relative Weights (or Sail) will best be determined by repeated
    Experiments; will not such an Apparatus or Anemometer-Sail, acting as a
    Vis Inertiæ nearly at right Angles against the Force of the Wind, check
    the Balloon; till the encreasing Resistence raising the Sail upwards
    towards the Horizon diminishes its Power of Action? With this Sail
    therefore, which requires little Attention; and with the Assistance of
    Wings moved by Levers, pressed alternately downwards as the Bellows
    of an Organ, by the Feet of the Aironaut and mere Weight of his Body,
    standing upright near the Center of the Car; the Balloon may probably
    be, in some Respect, subject to Direction, and move obliquely against
    the Wind, or with Force in a Calm.</p>

  <p>The Balloon and Anemòmeter-Sail, like the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>Earth and Moon will
    turn on their common Center of Gravity.</p>

  <p>315. 5. It is possible to erect a light hollow Mast throu’ the Car, and
    throu’ the Balloon, by Means of a cylindrical Tube of varnished Silk,
    extending from Top to Bottom, in order to sustain the Balloon in an
    upright Situation, and make it keep Pace with the Car, when the latter
    is propelled by the Wings. The Mast shoud be covered with soft Cotton,
    to lessen the Roughness of the Friction. It may also contain within it,
    another slenderer hollow Mast, after the Manner of a Cane Fish-Rod;
    either to be lowered out, and placed horizontally across or below the
    Car, to serve as a Guard for the Bottom of the Anemòmeter-Sail; or to
    be let down to any Depth occasionally: and other Sails connected, by
    the usual wooden Rings, and kept tight by Cords running throu’ Blocks
    fastened to any Part of <em>the equatorial Hoop</em>, as used at first,
    by the <em>gallant Admiral of the Air</em> <em class="smcap">blanchard</em>, and
    afterwards too precipitately rejected; since, in Case of a Rupture of
    Gass throu’ the upper Hemisphere of the Balloon; the equatorial Hoop
    preserves the Parashute complete: and for Want of which Hoop, young
    Arnold had certainly lost his Life, if the Water of the Thames had not
    broke his Fall.</p>

  <p>During the Descent of the Balloon, the Sails are to be taken in, and
    the lower Mast projected into its Socket.</p>

  <p>315. 6. Different Trials may be repeatedly made: the Effects of
    which, whether evidently useful or <em>apparently otherwise</em>,
    being carefully recorded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> and regularly published <em>in
    Detail</em>, may afford Data for the Prosecution of further Discoveries, and
    lay the Foundation for a rational Superstructure of <em>airostatic
    Navigation</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">On the Manner in which the Wind, Anemòmeter, and propulsive
    Machinery will probably operate on the Balloon.</div>

  <p id="section_316">Sect. 316. Art. 1. By adding Weights, and encreasing the Surface of
    Anemòmeter-Sails; the Vis Inertiæ will become so powerful in the
    Direction of the resisting Medium of the Air; that the Wind in the
    opposite Direction will force the Balloon out of its Vertical, and
    incline it to the Horizon. The Car will be a Fulcrum Axis or Center of
    Motion: on an imaginary Point of which, as on a Pivot, the Balloon and
    Sails will turn opposite Ways, balancing each other in every Situation.</p>

  <p>316. 2. The Balloon must therefore be brought back into the Vertical by
    a counter Exertion of the Wings: to which the Vis Inertiæ must always
    be made to bear a just Proportion.</p>

  <p>The Declination of the Balloon is the only Inconvenience foreseen to
    result from an Anemòmeter too large, or too heavily laden: and it is
    instantly remedied by slacking the Sail.</p>

  <p>One Thing still remains to be mentioned.</p>

  <p id="section_317">317. Balloons <em>durably</em> Air-tight, and terminating in a
    <em>Hemisphere</em> above, (<a href="#section_307">Section 307</a>); ought to have their Dimensions
    such, that there shoud be no Occasion for more than their upper
    Hemisphere to be inflated. Under which Form, they may with Ease and
    Safety be pitched as Tents on the Ground; by Cords fastened at equal
    Distances to the equatorial Hoop; and on Occasion by the Aironaut
    himself, while in the Car: who may be provided with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> Iron Ring
    Stakes barbed, and fastened or ready to be fastened to each Balloon-Cord: and,
    as soon as the Balloon is moored by the Anchor, Grapple, and snatch
    Block, (<a href="#section_298">Section 298</a>, 3) with a light Axe drive down the Stakes round
    the Car, and regulate them when he alights from it, on the Ground.</p>

    where they touch the Circle, forms a Space, which is the Shape sought.</p>

    Mast, or Pole 18 or 20 Feet long, perpendicularly throu’ it. (<a href="#section_315_3">315, 3</a>.)</p>

  <p>At the Distance of five Feet from the upper End of the Pole, a light
    hollow cylindric Tube of Iron, one Foot long, as a Bolt, shoud be put
    throu’ it, at right Angles: so as to play smoothly in two Iron Bends,
    fixed in the Car; one Bend so far moveable, as to rise with a Hinge to
    admit the End of the Bolt; the other Part of the Bend to be perforated:
    throu’ which a hollow Staple is to be fastened, with a spring Cotterel
    chained: this Apparatus will prevent the Pole from turning round.</p>

  <p>Two light Frames of Wood, of a parallelogrammic Form, each twelve Feet
    by six, and covered with varnished Silk, are to be hooked, one on each
    of the opposite Sides of the Pole, from its lower End upwards; the
    Frames to be moveable in such a Manner, that on pressing the Pole one
    Way on the Axis or Bolt, the Frames shall lie close; but on recovering
    the Pressure, the Frames shall expand and open, so as to form an obtuse
    Angle with each other, or to lie almost in the same Plane, when the
    Recovery is made briskly, and with a Degree of Strength.</p>

  <p>A Handle of Wood, the same Size with the Bolt, may be fastened throu’
    the Substance of the Pole near its upper End.</p>

  <p>The Operator is to stand in the Car, and work the Pole backwards and
    forwards, which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> give a progressive Motion to the Balloon in
    a Calm.</p>

  <p>This Method may possibly prove more effectual than the Umbrella-Wheels,
    on an horizontal Axis, of Mons. Carra;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> as the
    Umbrella-Pendulum is easily unrigged, removed, and brought into the Car, in Case of a
    Whirlwind; by Means of a <em>circular</em> Rope fastened to the Axis or
    Bolt, one End being in the Car, and the other put throu’ the Aperture
    at the Bottom, and brought up from the Outside again into the Car.</p>

  <p>The Umbrella-Pendulum may be made to turn round horizontally on the
    Bolt; the Ends of the Bolt being fastened under a circular hinged
    Socket, or Groove, of Iron.</p>

  <h3>DEFECTS, IN THE COMPOSITION FOR BALLOONS, REMEDIED.<br>ALSO ON THE COCHUC-VARNISH.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_320">Section 320.</span> BALLOONS are defective in the Composition for <em>the
    Varnish</em>; which, till lately, was incapable of rendering the Balloon
    completely and <em>durably</em> Air-tight.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <p id="section_321">321. It was sometime ago reported at Paris, that Mr. Dutourny
    de Villiere had undertaken to construct a Balloon so truly
    <em>impèrmeable</em>, that he woud warrant the Duration of it, for
    <em>several Weeks</em> in the Air.</p>

  <p>And it is <em>since</em> known that this <em>Desideratum</em> of the Art
    has been effected, in the Composition for the celebrated Balloon of
    Messrs. Auban and Vallet, <em class="smcap">first</em> made subject to Direction.</p>

  <p id="section_322">322. Mr. Berniard, a French Chymist, has made curious tho’ unsuccessful
    Experiments, in order to melt the cochuc or elastic Bottle; as may be
    seen in the 17th Volume of the “Journal de Physique.”</p>

  <p>Mr. Faujas and others made similar Trials.</p>

  <p id="section_323">323. The Writer, unacquainted with what had <em>then</em> been done
    in this Matter, coud not help remarking the striking Properties of
    the <em>Cochuc</em> in its present Form, to answer every Intention
    of the best Varnish, if its Price was lower;—viz. <em>compact</em>,
    <em>pliant</em>, <em>unadhesive</em>, and <em>unalterable by Weather</em>;—if
    it coud be dissolved, and afterwards made to recover its present
    <em class="smcap">unadhesive</em> Form: an Art in which the East and West-Indians are
    still <em>our Masters</em>.</p>

  <p>He has, however, after expensive Trials and Combinations, been able to
    reduce it into a <em>limpid Liquor</em>.</p>

  <p>As it may prove a useful Ingredient for <em>Air-tight</em> Varnish; the
    Secret he now discovers to the World: and it is merely this.</p>

  <p id="section_324">324. “Take any Quantity of the Cochuc, as two Ounces Averdupois: cut it
    into small Bits, with a Pair of Scissars.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

  <p>Put a strong Iron-Ladle (such as Plumbers or Glaziers melt their
    <em>Lead</em> in) over a common Pit-Coal or other Fire.</p>

  <p>The Fire must be gentle, glowing, and <em>without</em> Smoke.</p>

  <p>When the Ladle is hot, much below a <em class="smcap">red</em> <em>Heat</em>; put a
    single Bit into the Ladle.</p>

  <p>If <em>black</em> Smoke issues, it will presently <em>flame</em>, and
    disappear: or it will evaporate without Flame: the Ladle is <em>then</em>
    too hot.</p>

  <p>When the Ladle is less hot, put in a second Bit, which will produce a
    <em class="smcap">white</em> <em>Smoke</em>.</p>

  <p>This <em class="smcap">white</em> <em>Smoke</em> will continue during the Operation,
    and evaporate the Cochuc: therefore no Time is to be lost: but little
    Bits are to be put in, a few at a Time, till the whole are melted. It
    shoud be continually and gently stirred with an Iron or Brass Spoon.</p>

  <p>The Instant the Smoke changes from <em>white</em> to <em class="smcap">black</em>, take
    off the Ladle; or the whole will break out into a violent Flame, and be
    spoiled or lost.</p>

  <p>(Care must be taken that <em>no Water</em> be added: a few Drops only of
    which, woud—on Account of its superior <em>specific Gravity</em>, for the
    Cochuc swims in Water—make it boil over furiously, with great Noise.)</p>

  <p>At this Period of the Process; two Pounds, or one Quart of the
    <em class="smcap">best drying-oil</em>, (or even of <em>raw</em> Linseed-Oil, which,
    together with a few Drops of Neat’s-Foot-Oil, must have stood a Month,
    or not so long, on a Lump of Quick-Lime, to make it more or less
    <em class="smcap">drying</em>)—being poured off the Lime-Lees; is to be put into the<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_254">254</span> melted Cochuc, and stirred till hot: and the whole poured into a glazed
    Vessel, throu’ a coarse Gauze, or fine Sieve.</p>

  <p>When settled and clear, which will be in a few Minutes; it is fit for
    Use, either hot or cold.</p>

  <p>The Silk shoud be stretched all Ways horizontally, by Pins or
    Tenter-Hooks, on Frames; which Frames, the greater they are in Length,
    the better: and the Varnish poured on <em class="smcap">cold</em>, in <em>hot</em>
    Weather; and <em class="smcap">hot</em>, in <em>cold</em> Weather.</p>

  <p>It is <em>perhaps</em> best, always to lay it on, when <em>cold</em>.</p>

  <p>The Art of laying it on properly, consists in making <em class="smcap">no

  <h3>ON VARNISHES, CONTINUED.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_325">Section 325.</span> TO those, who are unacquainted with the Principles of
    Chemistry, or the Books which teach it; and yet are desirous to make
    Experiments, which may throw fresh Light on this curious and useful
    Art, when applied to Varnishes for Umbrellas or Balloons; the following
    detached Notes are recommended: which were communicated to the Author
    by <em>different</em> Artists; each <em>eminent</em> in his Profession.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

  <p id="section_326">326. To make copal Varnish.</p>

  <p>Procure some bluish Flemish alcaline Ashes, (an Ounce suppose): pound
    them <em>very fine</em>, and lay them before the Fire, till they become
    <em>hot</em> and <em class="smcap">dry</em>.</p>

  <p>Put them, while hot and dry, into Oil of Turpentine, (a Pint or Pound
    for Instance): or, into the same Quantity of Spirits of Wine.</p>

  <p>For by Means of the Alcaly,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> all the Water
    invisibly contained in
    the Oil or Spirits will be absorbed, and leave the Oil or Spirits,
    <em class="smcap">alcohol</em>, that is, quite pure, and highly rectified: which
    Process is called <em>alcalizing</em> the Turpentine, or Spirits.</p>

  <p>Put the Turpentine or Spirits so alcalized, into a Copper Vessel, with
    half an Ounce of <em class="smcap">yellow copal</em> <em>finely</em> pounded and sifted.</p>

  <p>Stir it, and the Copal will soon melt.</p>

  <p>N.&nbsp;B. If you alcalize the Spirit of Turpentine, when the Copal is
    dissolving, add a little Spirit of Wine: and if you alcalize the
    Spirit of Wine, when the Copal is dissolving, add a little Spirit of
    Turpentine.</p>

  <p>The <em class="smcap">sediment</em> of the Varnish will dry on the Silk, in a few
    Hours.</p>

  <p>The thicker the Varnish, the sooner it dries.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">To make <em>thin</em> Varnish.</div>

  <p id="section_327">327. Article 1. To make an excellent <em class="smcap">thin</em> Varnish.</p>

  <p>To one Quart of <em>cold raw</em> Linseed-Oil poured off from the Lees
    made by a Lump of <em>unslacked</em> Lime on which the Oil has stood, ten
    or eight Days, at the least, in order to communicate a drying Quality:
    (or on <em>brown Umber</em> burnt and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>pounded, which will have the
    like
    Effect:)—add half an Ounce of Litharge.</p>

  <p>Boil them for half an Hour.</p>

  <p>Then add half an Ounce of <em>the Copal Varnish</em>.</p>

  <p>327. 2. While the Ingredients are on the Fire, in a Copper Vessel; put
    in one Ounce of Chio Turpentine, or common Rezin: and a few Drops of
    <em class="smcap">neat’s-foot-oil</em>: and stir the whole with a Knife, or any clean
    Thing.</p>

  <p>When <em>cold</em>, it is ready for Use.</p>

  <p>327. 3. The Neat’s-Foot-Oil prevents the Varnish from being sticky, or
    adhèsive: and may be put into the Linseed-Oil, at the same Time with
    the Lime, or burnt Umber.</p>

  <p>327. 4. To make the above Varnish <em>transparent</em>, or <em>white</em>;
    use Mastic and Copal: to make it <em>brown</em>, use Seed or Shell-Lac,
    and <em>browner still</em>, use <em>pounded burnt</em> Umber.</p>

  <p>327. 5. <em>Rezin</em>, or <em>Chio Turpentine</em> may be added, till the
    Varnish has obtained the desired <em>Thickness</em>.</p>

  <p>327. 6. It must likewise be observed, that <em>Litharge</em> rots the
    Silk: therefore Trials must be made without the Use of Litharge.</p>

  <p>327. 7. The <em>longer</em> the raw Linseed-Oil remains on the unslacked
    Lime, or Umber, the <em>sooner</em> will the Oil dry, after it is used.</p>

  <p>If some Months; so much the better. Such Varnish will <em>set</em>, i.&nbsp;e.
    will not run, but keep its Place on the Silk, in four Hours.</p>

  <p>The Silk may then be turned, and varnished on the other Side.</p>

  <p id="section_328">328. <em class="smcap">on gum mastic, sandarac, seed-lac, shell-lac, and copal.</em></p>

  <p>328. 1. Gum <em>Mastic</em> dissolves, <em>without pounding</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> by
    adding a few Drops of Oil of Vitriol: so do Gum <em>Sandarac</em>, and
    Gum <em>Copal</em>, when finely pounded and sifted.</p>

  <p>328. 2. Gum <em>Sandarac</em>, and Gum <em>Mastic</em> are great Driers of
    themselves: and may be substituted for Litharge.</p>

  <p>328. 3. The Mastic dissolved in the Oil of Vitriol, gives a
    <em>sweet</em> Smell to the Varnish.</p>

  <p>328. 4. Sandarac will soon grow <em>dusk</em> in the Fire: it melts into
    a transparent Liquor.</p>

  <p>328. 5. Sandarac, Seed-Lac, and Shell-Lac, must be finely pounded and
    sifted, before they are used.</p>

  <p id="section_329">329. The Author having examined different Kinds of varnished Silks,
    in different Places, does, from their Excellence, recommend those
    made by <em>Fawkner</em>, Umbrella-Maker, Alport-Street, Manchester; a
    Person wholly unknown to him, but from the Merit of the Work: which
    consists not only in the Varnish itself; but in the peculiar Method
    of <em>applying</em> it, which the Author <em>is not at Liberty to make
    public</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Fawkner</em> can warrant his Silk <em>Air-tight</em>; <em>soft</em> and
    <em>unadhesive</em>; durable, and <em>unalterable</em> by that Excess of
    Heat and Cold, to which the Balloon is, at the same Time, subject; viz.
    <em>internally</em>, to the hot depredating and caustic Fumes, rising
    with the Gass: and <em>externally</em>, to the <em>Sun</em>, <em>Wet</em>,
    <em>Frost</em>, and <em>Drought</em>.</p>

  <h3>HINTS ON IMPROVEMENT OF THE MACHINERY.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_330">Section 330.</span> IN order to make Improvements of the Balloon still more
    rapid and general; the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, who have
    given no particular Encouragement, in Imitation of that at Lyons, to
    the much-wished-for Art of directing the Balloon;—might offer a Premium
    for different Inventions of a <em>propulsive Machinery</em>, the Models
    of which are to be made at the Expence of the Society, within a certain
    limited Sum: and, without condemning what cannot be known unless by
    repeated Trials,—give Encouragement for such Trials: the Models to
    remain with the Society for public Exhibition.</p>

  <p id="section_331">331. Also, Figures and Explanations of such Machinery as have been
    tried, viz. the Fly or Moulinet of Blanchard; and of those which have
    not succeeded for Want of Trial; might be sent by the Inventors,
    in order to perpetuate the Invention, either to the <em>Society of
    Arts</em>; or to the Editors of creditable Magazines, who woud be glad
    of such ingenious Acquisitions, as it woud be a Means of procuring
    Purchasers, and circulate the Knowledge of this <em>gigantic</em> Infant Science.</p>

  <p>Improvement woud then go on apace, and in a Chain: each Labourer
    forging and finishing his respective Link.</p>

  <p>Whereas at present every one is obliged to find his own Materials, sink
    the Foundation, raise and finish the Building. And hence so little Work
    is done, worthy the Inspection of a skilful Architect.</p>

  <h3>ON THE UTILITY OF BALLOONS:<br>
    AN INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_332">Sect. 332. Art. 1.</span>IT seems a favourite Question, among those who
    take a Pleasure in objecting to every Thing they neither do nor will
    understand, to ask, “Of what Use can these Balloons be made?” and
    without waiting for an Answer, to say—“they pick the Pockets of the
    Public, risque the Lives of the Incautious, encourage Mobbing and
    Sharpers, and terrify all the World.” These trite Reasonings are all
    very true, but little to the Purpose: the Effects above described being
    merely those arising from Novelty. If, says one in an inferior Station;
    “they coud convert Balloons into common Stage Waggons; Goods might be
    carried with the greater Expedition:” or, “into Stage Coaches,” says
    another: or, “into Mail Coaches” says Palmer; “it woud be certainly
    very clever, as I have the Patent:”—“or into comfortable Carriages to
    step in out of <em class="smcap">the window</em>, at a Moment’s Notice; that woud
    be something,” cries a Nobleman: “it woud <em>save</em> one a Couple
    of Sets of Horses, and woud eat Nothing: one might ride one’s own
    Balloon Matches, from one’s Window to Newmarket, and from Newmarket to
    <em class="smcap">town</em>; dress for Court as we <em>do</em>, and make <em>Nothing</em>
    of it.”</p>

  <p>Such are the different Ideas annexed by different Ranks of Men, to the
    Word <em class="smcap">utility</em> when applied to Balloons.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

  <p>332. 2. For once let the feeble Voice of a French Philosopher be heard,
    the Abbée Bertholon: who may perhaps assert that all this is not
    impossible.</p>

  <p>A Series of Experiments only can determine: and let the following
    Remarks serve as an Introduction to his Opinions.</p>

  <p>332. 3. It is certain that the Progress already made in the Improvement
    of Balloons, since their Invention only three Years ago, is far
    superior to the Acquirements in every other Art.</p>

  <p>The Antients knew, that excited Amber attracted Straws, and certain
    other light Substances: but medical Electricity, and a Preservative
    from Lightening, were notwithstanding reserved for the Moderns.</p>

  <p>They likewise attended to some striking Effects of the natural
    Loadstone: but were totally unacquainted with the artificial Magnet,
    and the amazing Powers conferrable by it in the Disorders of the
    Imagination: nor did they know the Polarity of its Needle, or
    Application of it in the Compass.</p>

  <p>They had not combined Nitre and Sulphur with Charcoal: much less had
    they changed the Mode of War into Science, by establishing Founderies
    for Cannon, and the Study of Tactics. Yet some Nations with a
    Knowledge of the Moderns, as the Chinese, have not improved, even in
    the Construction of their Vessels, according to the European Manner;
    continuing still in practical Ignorance.</p>

  <p>Nor have other Indians improved in Proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> to the
    Opportunities of
    Instruction in several Arts.</p>

  <p>Those of America, for Example, who continue to hunt, fish, and scalp:
    neglecting the Plough, and other Arts of Property and Peace.</p>

  <p>332. 4. And thus it has been with the British Nation on the Subject of
    Airostation.</p>

  <p>Cavendish, Priestley, and others, had produced inflammable Air,
    weighed, and found it lighter than common Air: and all that had seen a
    bright Fire might conclude, if they reasoned at all, that hot Air was
    lighter than cold.</p>

  <p>Yet if Montgolfier had not made, <span class="smcap">on a large scale</span> the
    Application of hot Air, in a Bag open at the Bottom, and properly
    poised; Charles and Roberts woud probably not have thought of applying
    the Gass of Cavendish: and Mankind woud not <em>yet</em> have soared into
    the etherial Regions.</p>

  <p>332. 5. In this the French are still before the English, and will
    continue so to be, without a laudable and unlooked-for Emulation in the
    latter. That the former admire Liberty, Montesquieu’s “Spirit of Laws”
    may determine; but they are not <em>addicted</em> to Politics. Their
    Nobility are endowed with a liberal and enterprizing Spirit. They join
    and patronize Men of Genius and Talents in the Cultivation of the Arts,
    and Improvement of every Kind of experimental Knowledge. Their Pleasure
    consists in a national Ambition to excel.</p>

  <p>They have Leisure, and are sober.</p>

  <p>Half that Time which Men of Fortune in France dedicate to Taste,
    Invention, and Refinement;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> Britons spend among the Beasts and
    Birds: the other half, at the Bottle, and in political Cabals.</p>

  <p><em>Present Profit</em> is almost the sole Motive for Excellence in
    Great-Britain: and Experiments&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> not made with
    that View, are seldom
    repeated; are overlooked and forgotten.</p>

  <h3>ON THE UTILITY OF BALLOONS.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_333">Section 333.</span> THE Balloon opens a new and unlimited Field for
    Philosophical Discoveries.</p>

  <p id="section_334">334. The many curious and interesting Conjectures which Mons. de Luc
    (before the Invention of Balloons) throws out, in the Course of 4 large
    Volumes, on the Subject and Qualities of the Atmosphere; may now be
    determined by actual Trial.</p>

  <p id="section_335">335. The Abbée Bertholon wrote in 1784: and has particularly mentioned
    the following Points, as capable of ample Investigation, and.
    Discussion.</p>

  <p id="section_336">Sect. 336. Art. 1. <em>The Temperature of the Air at different Heights.</em></p>

  <p>Which will determine whether the Atmosphere be <em>practically
    Navigable</em>, at all Times and Places.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

  <p>336. 2. <em>The dissolvent Power of the Air by Means of an Atmometer
    for Evaporation.</em></p>

  <p>Probably the Height may be determined, to which Clouds commonly ascend
    in order to find the proper horizontal Level, in which Balloons can
    move with the greatest Ease, Safety, and Expedition.</p>

  <p>336. 3. <em>Variations of the Barometer.</em></p>

  <p>This will ascertain the exact Height, without Mensuration.</p>

  <p>336. 4. <em>The</em> <em class="smcap">densities</em> <em>at different Heights</em>.</p>

  <p>A principal Object in de Luc’s abstruse and scientific Researches: not
    only useful but necessary to determine the Laws of Refraction; without
    which, Astronomy, and consequently <em class="smcap">navigation</em>, must remain
    defective.</p>

  <p>336. 5. <em>The different Effects of Tastes and Odors, at different
    Heights</em>: <em>Experiments on Plants and Animals: also of</em>
    <em class="smcap">sound</em>.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

  <p>These may produce new and salutary Effects on the human Body: and
    determine how far a Change from hot, putrid, and impure, to cool pure
    Air, impregnated with the invigorating aërial Acid, may contribute,
    without the Aid of Drugs, to the Recovery of the Sick, and Invalid: or
    promote Longevity.</p>

  <p>336. 6. <em>The Direction and Velocity of the Wind.</em></p>

  <p>The different Currents and their different Heights, the Limitation of
    each Stratum of Wind, together with their different Temperatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
    at the same Time, will point out the proper Paths for the Balloon to move
    in, at all Times, and <em>possibly</em> without the Necessity of accurate
    Direction: the Mode of Ascent and Descent being <em>already</em> known,
    and proper Instructions given for a secure Landing.</p>

  <p>336. 7. <em>Electricity of the Air</em>, <em class="smcap">meteors</em>.</p>

  <p>This may lead to the Birth Place of Lightening, and Methods how to
    avoid its Effects in the Air. Tho’ it be already known, that little
    Danger is to be apprehended, on Account of the mutual Repellency
    between the electric Fluid, inflammable Gass, and oiled Silk.</p>

  <p>The Irides, the Coronaes, Haloes, and other Phenomena of Colours: the
    Generation and Solution of which may be investigated on the Spot.</p>

  <p>336. 8. <em>Geography may become a new Science.</em></p>

  <p>336. 9. <em>Use of the Balloon for Signals in the calm Air, above
      Molestation; above Winds still blowing below: to discover the Positions
      of an Army, or Navy.</em>&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

  <p>336. 10. <em>To throw principal Men into a Town: and convey others out
      of it.</em></p>

  <p>336. 11. With the Montgolfier Balloon, to try Experiments on Light, and
    Fire: to transport great Weights: raise them out of the Water: draw up
    Piles, raise Trees, Vessels, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>336. 12. The Parashute to secure a Man from too precipitate a Fall, is
    to be 5 Yards in Diameter, when extended: the Man,—weighing 140 Pounds,
    and the Parashute weighing 10 Pounds, with a Surface of 150 square
    Feet,—woud, in that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>Case, feel no greater Shock than if he had
    fallen from the Height of six Feet.</p>

  <p>336. 13. <em>Compass and its Variations: also the different Branches in Astronomy.</em></p>

  <p>His Hints on the Direction of the Machine are ingenious.</p>

  <p id="section_337">337. 1. Wheels furnished with Wings.</p>

  <p>337. 2. Imitations of the Form and Motions of Fish.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

  <p>337. 3. Vessels to condense Air, as the Bladders of Fish.</p>

  <p>337. 4. Wind-Guns, Wind-Fountains.</p>

  <p>337. 5. Elopile and Vapour Steam.</p>

  <p>337. 6. Contrary Currents at different Heights: Proof of.</p>

  <p>337. 7. New Hints for Balloons to be raised by Steam.</p>

  <p>337. 8. Mons. Gouan’s Invention to go <em class="smcap">three hundred miles a day in
    a calm</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_338">338. The general Use to which Balloons seem capable of being applied,
    with the Assistance of propulsive Machinery, in the Calm which exists
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>above the Level of a <em class="smcap">contrary</em> Wind; is
    that of a common Vehicle, not subject to the Inconvenience of Roads and Inns, between
    distant Places and Countries, for Passengers, properly accommodated in
    a Boat-shaped covered Car, furnished with Provisions, and occasional
    Siberian Cloathing: the Car to be surrounded with, and resting on
    Bladders, one <em>fourth blown</em>, and having each a few Drops of Water
    within, to keep them moist and elastic;—to prevent an <em>accidental</em>
    Shock in alighting on Land; and from sinking, if on Water.</p>

  <p>Such a Conveyance (the Balloon being once made <em>Air-tight</em>, and
    furnished with an <em>Air-Bottle</em> to ascend and descend <em>without
    Loss</em> of Gass) is ready at all Seasons and Times: both Night and
    Day: for, as the Aironauts will enjoy continual Sunshine without a
    Cloud, from his Rising to his Setting: so, during the Night, the Light
    of the <em class="smcap">stars</em>, always intercepted in its Passage to the Earth
    by Clouds or thick Vapours, will be greatly augmented, when above both:
    besides the probable Increase of Light <em>reflected</em> from the upper
    Fields of white Clouds shone on continually by the different Planets
    and Constellations: all which will afford an Illumination equal, if
    not greater, than that of a cloudless frosty Night, when the Ground is
    covered with Snow.</p>

  <p>And such Light will be sufficient to read or write by: also to examine
    the <em>Barometer</em>,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> in order to know the
    <em>Height</em> and Level
    of the Balloon above the Surface of the Earth; and the <em class="smcap">compass</em>
    for Direction.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

  <p>If Aironauts propose to ascend by Night, and in the Moon’s Quarters;
    observing likewise the Precautions already given; it may be proper also
    to consult and take with them the Ephèmeris, in order to know the Time
    when the Moon rises, and also when she is at the highest, i.&nbsp;e. in the
    South, or has remained about half her Time above the Horizon.</p>

  <p>The plainest Points, on which not only the Success of an Excursion, but
    the Lives of Aironauts may depend, are too frequently neglected, as
    unimportant and trivial.</p>

  <h3>THE PROCESS OF INFLATION.</h3>

  <div class="sidenote">Process of Inflation on the Day of Ascent, viz. on Thursday
    the 8th Sept. 1785.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_339">Sect. 339. Art. 1.</span>THREE cylindric wooden Vessels were sunk more than
    half their Depth into the Ground: two of them, each, 5 Feet Diameter,
    and 5 Feet high: the third, 8 Feet in Diameter, and 8 Feet high.</p>

  <p>An oblong Hole, 4 Inches by 3, was made in each Vessel: and each Hole
    was furnished with a solid wooden Plug (made tapering) 6 Inches in
    Length: throu’ these the Vitriol was poured.</p>

  <p>Besides which, there was an oblong Opening in each Vessel, large enough
    to admit a Workman, to distribute the Iron equally over the Bottom, and
    to pour in Buckets of Water: which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> Openings were well stopped, as
    soon as the Iron and Water were poured in.</p>

  <p>As the vitriolic Acid is <em>corrosive</em>, burning the Skin or Cloaths;
    the following Precautions were taken.</p>

  <p>An occasional moveable Tub was provided, 3 Feet high, and 3 wide: in
    the Center of whose Bottom was an oblong Aperture, equal to that in
    each of the Vessels: a corresponding Tin Tube, 6 Inches long, and
    narrowing to the Bottom, was nailed by its Border on the Inside of the
    occasional Tub; so as to go easily into any of the oblong Holes.</p>

  <p>A Bottle of Vitriol being brought in its Basket by two Men, and made
    to rest on the Top of one of the fermenting Vessels; a third Assistant
    held the occasional Tub in his Hands, with the Plug-Staff fastened in
    the Aperture of the Tin Tube; and the Instant a fourth Person opened
    the Hole in the fermenting Vessel; the Assistant placed the Tin Tube in
    the Hole, keeping the Plug tight, to prevent the Escape of Gass.</p>

  <p>The Bottle of Vitriol was then immediately poured into the occasional
    Tub: and the Bottle being removed, the Plug-Staff was taken out, and
    the Vitriol suffered to run into the fermenting Vessel: the Assistant
    watching for the Instant when the Vitriol was run out, in order to
    <em>force in</em> the Plug-Staff again, and prevent the Escape of Gass:
    after which, the Tub was rinced with a few Quarts of Water, let also
    into the Vessel.</p>

  <p>The same Tub was then removed: the oblong Hole in the fermenting
    Vessel instantly covered; and, by driving down the solid wooden Plug,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
    continued <em>Air-tight</em>; by Means of moist Clay, and a little Water,
    kept purposely on the Tops of each Vessel, to discover by the Bubbles,
    whether Gass escaped.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">20 Hundred Weight of Iron-Turnings.</div>

  <p>In these Vessels, early on the Morning of the Inflation, were
    distributed 20 Hundred Weight, at 120lb. Averdupoise to the Hundred,
    consisting of cast Iron-Filings, and of a Mixture of Cannon-Borings.</p>

  <p>The Borings were bright and fresh when thrown into the Water: and any
    Bits of Wood that swam, were skimmed off.</p>

  <p><em>Rusty</em> Iron emits Gass, that is heavier than common Air, and
    therefore is improper.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">16 Bottles of Vitriol.</div>

  <p>At the same Time, 16 Bottles of concentrated vitriolic Acid, or as it
    is improperly called Oil of Vitriol, were brought in their Packages
    near the Place, to be ready for Use: each Bottle at an Average
    containing 112 Pounds Averdupoise, of Vitriol: each full Bottle and
    Package together weighing from 136 to 148 Pounds.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">4 Pints of Water to a Pound Averdupoise of Acid.</div>

  <p>339. 2. To the Iron in each Vessel, was then poured a Quantity of
    Water, which was measured in the Proportion of about 4 to 1: i.&nbsp;e. 4
    <em>Pints</em> of Water to one <em>Pound</em>, of the vitriolic Acid.</p>

  <p>The Height of Water and Iron in each Vessel, being then gaged, was
    about 14 Inches.</p>

  <p>In a Line with the two smaller Vessels, and between them, was fixed
    another wooden Vessel or Cistern, filled with Water.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Improvements suggested.</div>

  <p>(N.&nbsp;B. Fresh Water ought to have flowed continually into it, and to
    have run over the Top of the Cistern: for the same Quantity being
    once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> saturated, can no longer absorb the alcaline and fixed Air
    to be separated from the Gass before the latter enters the Balloon.)</p>

  <p>In the Cistern was fixed a Stage, consisting of 4 long Feet, (reaching
    to the Bottom of the Cistern,) nailed at their upper Ends to the Inside
    of an inverted Tub or Funnel, so placed over the Center of the Cistern,
    that 3 Inches of the lower Part of the Rim of the Funnel were under the
    Surface of the Cistern-Water: the Funnel was <em>cylindric</em>, 3 Feet
    across, and 2 Feet high.</p>

  <p>An Open was cut, 1 Foot Diameter, in the Bottom of the inverted
    Funnel: on the Circumference of which was nailed a Tin-Cylinder or
    common Conductor, 2 Feet high: and at a <em>certain</em> Angle, as most
    convenient, was soldered a cylindric Arm, of equal Diameter, and 1 Foot
    long; having a Lip, Ring or Rim, on its outward circular Edge.</p>

  <p>Round this Rim was fastened a varnished Linen Tube, of equal Diameter
    with the Cylinder.</p>

  <p>At a small Distance, about a Yard from the Cistern, stood a slender
    Stillage, 3 Feet high; on which was supported a detached Tin-Cylinder
    or Connecter, 1 Foot long and 1 Foot Diameter, made with a Rim at
    each End: in the Center of whose lower Side was soldered, at right
    Angles, another Tin-Cylinder or Evacuatory, 6 Inches long and 6 wide:
    its Use is to let out any Water, that the Heat of the Mixture might
    cause to boil and rise up out of the fermenting Vessels: and thus be
    <em>evacuated</em>, without entering the Balloon: or, if condensed in the
    Balloon, might run out by the same Orifice.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

  <p>The opposite End of the varnished Linen Tube was fastened round one End
    of the detached Cylinder on the Stillage: and round the other, was tyed
    the Neck or Bottom-Opening of the Balloon.</p>

  <p>Each of the 2 smaller fermenting Vessels was furnished with a cylindric
    Tin-Tube; each Tube 4 Inches and a half Diameter, nailed on the Outside
    of a circular Opening in the Top or Head of each Vessel; communicating
    by additional rectangular Bends under the Funnel and Water in the
    Cistern: the great fermenting Vessel had 2 Tubes, each 4 Inches and a
    half Diameter; communicating with the Funnel.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Improvements suggested.</div>

  <p id="section_340">340. The Process woud have been more complete, if the fermenting
    Vessels had been sunk till their Tops were even with the Ground: and
    plaistered round their Outsides with soft moist Clay, six Inches thick,
    to keep them Air-tight.</p>

  <p>Also, if the common Conductor had been only 1 Foot high: its horizontal
    or rectangular Arm only 6 Inches long: the Linen Trunk but 3 Feet,
    joining the Connecter on the Stillage 1 Foot high, to communicate with
    the Neck of the Balloon; which Neck shoud be 3 Yards in Length, and its
    circular Opening 1 Foot, at least in Diameter.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="sidenote">Inflation began about X. in the Morning.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_341">Section 341.</span>THE Process of inflating the Balloon began about X. in the
    Morning, by pouring 4 Bottles of Vitriol, immediately one after the
    other, into the occasional Tub, properly placed over one of the smaller
    fermenting Vessels: the Tub being instantly rinced with a few Quarts of
    Water, which was suffered to fall into the same Vessel.</p>

  <p>The oblong Hole was left purposely open for a Minute, till the strong
    Smell of the Gass was perceived above the Orifice: i.&nbsp;e. till the Gass
    had pressed out all the common Air that remained floating over the
    Surface of the Mixture in the fermenting Vessel: which Smell being
    <em>plainly perceived</em>, the <em>solid</em> Plug was immediately
    <em>driven</em> down.</p>

  <p>And presently the Gass was known to press forward with an elastic
    Force throu’ the Tin Conductor, by the Motion it communicated to the
    Surface of the Water in the Cistern: thence upwards throu’ the common
    Conductor: at its Departure from both of which throu’ the Linen Trunk,
    and Neck into the Balloon, the Gass makes a guggling obtuse Sound by
    quick Intervals according to the Quantity of Gass protruded.</p>

  <p>And as the Intervals encreased, a Judgment was formed, that the
    Operation began to be less vigorous: and consequently that it became
    necessary, either to renew it by an Addition of more Vitriol and Water
    in the same Vessel, or to set the other small Vessel in Fermentation,
    the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> of which Mr. Lunardi preferred: this happened about
    half an Hour after the Vitriol was poured into the first Vessel.</p>

  <p id="section_342">342. After the second half Hour, eight Bottles were poured, by four at
    a Time, into the great Vessel.</p>

  <p>And at one o’Clock, the Balloon, without any farther Trouble was
    beautifully inflated.</p>

  <p>No Iron Rods were used to stir up the Borings or Filings at the Bottom
    of the Vessels: the Vitriol being found so heavy as to penetrate them
    as fast as the Iron, contiguous to the Vitriol, had parted with its Gass.</p>

  <p>At each of the two former Inflations, a similar Accident happened which
    may be imputed to the same Cause.</p>

  <p id="section_343">343. During the first Inflation, the solid oblong wooden Plug fell into
    one of the fermenting Vessels: the hot Vapour, forcibly issuing from
    the Orifice, was condensed in the Form of a <em>white</em> Smoke; which
    being mistaken by the Company, a Cry was immediately heard of Fire,
    Fire: on which the Workmen retreated. Mr. Lunardi incautiously thrust
    his Arm into the Orifice to extract the Plug: at the same Time being
    much burnt, and failing in the Attempt; the Gass continued to escape,
    till a new Plug was prepared.</p>

  <p id="section_344">344. During the second Inflation, one of the Plugs being driven too
    forcibly; it was with Difficulty extricated, by the Strokes of a Hammer
    against the Sides of it, which tended at the same Time to displace the
    Boards forming the Top or Head of the Vessel: and, a little afterwards,
    occasioned it to burst, unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> <span
    class="smcap">inwards</span>,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
    rendering the Vessel useless for the Purpose of Inflation.</p>

  <p><em>Observation.</em> Therefore instead of the solid oblong wooden Plug,
    a circular Hole, 4 Inches Diameter shoud be drilled in each Vessel:
    and a corresponding solid wooden Plug 8 Inches long, 5 Diameter at the
    upper Part, and tapering to near 3 at the Bottom, shoud be prepared by
    the Turner.</p>

  <p>In the upper Part of the Solid shoud be turned an inside Screw, to
    which an outside Screw of the circular Plug-Staff, made of Oak, Ash, or
    other heavy Wood, 4 Feet long, and 4 Inches Diameter, shoud be adapted:
    the Worm of the Screw to be 5 Inches long.</p>

  <p>A wooden Peg of Ash, about a Quarter of an Inch Diameter, may be put
    throu’ a Hole near the Top of the Staff, as a Handle.</p>

  <p>A Lever of such a Length and Weight will probably answer every
    Intention, as no sudden Blows will be required to <em>fasten or extract it</em>.</p>

  <p>The occasional Tub, Tube, Plug, and Staff, shoud be fashioned after
    this Model.</p>

  <p><em>Observation 1.</em> A great Saving might be made by conducting the
    Process in a different Manner.</p>

  <p>The Author making two Journies to Manchester, purposely to observe the
    Process by Mr. Sadler; found that his Balloon was inflated in two Hours
    each Time; by Means only of the two smaller <em>identical</em> fermenting
    Vessels which Mr. Lunardi afterwards purchased; but the Levity procured
    by the former, tho’ he also expended 16 Bottles, was by no Means so
    great as that gained with the Assistance of the great Vessel.</p>

  <p>It has likewise been remarked by the Author, who has made several
    Experiments to this End, that the Vessels always continued in
    Fermentation and Ebullition, with a <em>quick Pulsation</em>, for at
    least 24, and commonly during 48 Hours, after the Inflation was
    completed.</p>

  <p>And, that not more than the Depth of <em>half an Inch</em> of Filings had
    been <em>calcined</em> during the Operation: the rest being perfectly
    <em>bright</em>, and untouched by the Acid.</p>

  <p><em>Observation. 2.</em> If therefore one Inch in Depth of Filings, be
    spread over the Bottom of each of the <em>smaller</em> Vessels only;
    the proper Quantity of Water poured in; and <em>not more</em> than two
    Bottles of Acid used at once, in each Vessel; also, as soon as the
    Fermentation begins to decline; other two Bottles, and a proportionable
    Supply of Water be added; if suffered to work double, triple, or
    quadruple the Time;—the Inflation will be as great, if not greater, for
    Instance, in six Hours with eight Bottles, and two small <em>Tubs</em>,
    as it woud in three Hours, with 16 Bottles, in the <em>same Vessels</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

  <p>The small conducting Tin Tubes ought instead of four and a half, to be
    nine Inches Diameter: by which Means there will be no violent Pressure
    of Gass to endanger the Bursting of the Vessels: particularly if the
    Gass is not suffered to descend; but, on the contrary, according to
    Instructions already given, either to rise, or move, in an horizontal
    Direction, past the Evàcuatory, into the Balloon.</p>

  <p id="section_346">346. The Workmen may begin the Operation at twelve at Night, or at six
    in the Morning: and the Time previously fixed for the Exhibition, may
    be eight or ten Hours after the Operation has commenced.</p>

  <p>The Necessity of a Current of fresh Water, throu’ a Pipe of at least
    half Inch Bore, the larger the better, to supply the overflowing
    Cistern, cannot be too much <em>insisted</em> on: as the Levity of the
    Gass almost wholly depends upon so trivial a Circumstance, as that of
    having a plentiful Supply of <em>cold fresh</em> and <em>soft</em> Water.</p>

  <p id="section_347">347. <em>Observation 3.</em> Supposing the Balloon <em class="smcap">air-tight</em>,
    near half the Expence is thus saved in the Inflation.</p>

  <p>Besides the greater Probability of <em class="smcap">calm</em> Weather for the
    Inflation, if completed before X. in the Morning, more Time is given to
    remedy Accidents, and rectify Mistakes: the Warmth of the Air likewise
    encreases.</p>

  <p>But above all; if an upper Current carry the Balloon to Sea, the
    Aironaut may, (as before mentioned) drop into the Sea-Breeze, which
    will waft him safe back till IV. in the Afternoon, or even later.</p>

    applied to those elevated Stations in the Atmosphere <em>attainable</em>
    only by Means of the Balloon, will henceforward become more useful,
    and be more frequently practised: as the Lives of Aironauts <em>may</em>
    depend on a Knowledge of their <em>Height</em> above the Earth; which,
    not being determinable by <em>Sight</em>, in <em>all Weathers</em>,
    or at all Times, must be referred to the <em>Barometer</em> and
    <em>Thermometers</em>, they carry up with them.</p>

  <p>De Luc, Horseley, Maskelyne, Shuckburgh, and Roy, have each written
    <em class="smcap">ably</em> on the Subject, in the <em>Transactions</em>: tho’ few have
    either Leisure or Inclination to follow them.</p>

  <p>Sir George Shuckburgh has made successful Attempts to smooth the Way,
    by Examples and Tables, yet is still too concise for actual Learners,
    and the Generality of those who will have Spirit enough to go before
    the Calculators in exploring the Atmosphere; but cannot dedicate
    sufficient Leisure to overtake them in their Studies.</p>

  <p>Each may therefore assist the other.</p>

  <p id="section_349">349. Whoever is at the Trouble of comparing the Observations made by
    Shuckburgh, with the Directions here given, will find that the latter
    contains the <em>Essentials</em> of the former, with this material
    Difference, that the Investigation moves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> here by Steps, which are
    all pointed out to the Learner; and not by Strides.</p>

  <p>Each Step is self evident: and, by carrying Conviction to the Mind, is
    just what the Mind itself woud make use of, in the Attainment of any
    <em>distant</em> Truth.</p>

  <p>To do every Justice to Sir George, the Merit of whose Performance wants
    no Eulogium; his three Precepts are copied; tho’ rather as a Memorandum
    for those who understand the Methods; than as plain Directions for such
    as are yet to learn them.</p>

  <p>It will be found likewise, that the first, second, and fourth Tables
    are greatly enlarged: being calculated for those <em>extreme</em>
    Temperatures, and Heights, which the Balloon <em>only</em> can attempt
    to reach: and the fourth Table, for greater Dispatch in computing the

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_350">Section 350.</span>METHODS to be pursued on taking and comparing Heights, in
    order to ascertain the true Height of any Station in the Atmosphere, by
    the Barometer and Thermometers.</p>

  <p>For this Purpose it is necessary, 1st, to provide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> a Barometer,
    (whose Bulb or Cistern is <em>large</em> enough to contain all the
    Quicksilver in the Tube;)—into the Frame of which, a Thermometer, on
    <em>Farenheit’s</em> Scale, is to be fixed or <em>attached</em>.</p>

  <p>The Use of the <em>attached Thermometer</em> is to point out the
    Temperature of the Barometer.</p>

  <p>2d. A second or <em>detached Thermometer</em> is also to be provided.&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
    class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

  <p>This is to be hung in the Shade at the Distance of a Yard (or two) from
    the other:—to shew the <em>general</em> Temperature of the Air at the
    same Time and Place: and may be called the <em>Air Thermometer</em>.</p>

  <p>A proper Person, on the Ground, having a good Watch, with Pen Ink and
    Paper at Hand, is to attend the Instruments <em>below</em> every ten
    Minutes, (or at any other <em>preconcerted</em> Intervals of Time,)
    putting down,</p>

  <p>1st. The Time of each Observation.</p>

  <p>2d. The Point at which the Quicksilver stands in the Barometer.</p>

  <p>3d. The Degree of Temperature of the <em>attached</em> Thermometer.</p>

  <p>4th, and lastly, the Degree of Temperature of the <em>detached</em> or
    <em>Air</em>-Thermometer.</p>

  <p>This Employment is to be carefully attended to; during the Time, that
    <em>similar</em> Observations, by <em>preconcerted</em> Agreement, are
    making, with three other <em>similar</em> Instruments, on the Top of the
    Mountain, or any elevated Station in the Atmosphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> by Means of
    the
    <em>Balloon</em>; and to be written with a <em>red Lead</em> Pencil, in a
    Patent Asses Skin Pocket Book.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Instruments to be compared on Return from the Mountain,
    or upper Station.</div>

  <p>Each single Observation, made with one Set of Instruments <em>below</em>,
    is to be compared with each single corresponding Observation, made with
    the other Set <em>above</em>.</p>

  <p>And two Observations are said to <em>correspond</em>, when both are made
    <em>nearly</em> at the <em>same</em> Time, the one <em>below</em>, and the

    577.) viz.</p>

  <p>“Let the Point at which the Quicksilver stands in the Barometer, on
    the Ground, be 29 Inches 4 tenths: the attached Thermometer 50 Degrees
    of Temperature, and the Air Thermometer, or general Temperature of the
    Air 45°: at the same Time, that at the Top of the Mountain, or other
    elevated Station in the Atmosphere, the Barometer stands at 25 Inches
    19 Tenths, the attached Thermometer at 46°, and the Air Thermometer at
    39° and 1⁄2: required the upper Height in English Feet.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Rules for the Work: and Practice of the first Example.</div>

  <p id="section_352">352. The Work is divided into three Stages.</p>

  <p>The End proposed in this first Stage is to bring the colder Barometer,
    to the same <em>Expansion</em> or <em>Temperature</em> with the
    <em>other</em>.</p>

  <p id="section_353">353. 1st. Step. First, write down the Observation made on the Ground,
    or at the Bottom of the Mountain, thus:</p>

  <p><em class="smcap">Below.</em> Barometer, 29 Inches 4 Tenths. attached Thermometer, 50
    Degrees. Air Thermometer, 45°.</p>

  <p id="section_354">354. 2d. Step. Secondly, write down the Observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> made at the
    Top of
    the Mountain, or upper Station in the Atmosphere, thus:</p>

  <p><em class="smcap">Above.</em> Barometer, 25 Inches, .19 Tenths. attached Thermometer,
    46°. Air Thermometer, 29&#x200B;1⁄2.</p>

  <p id="section_355">355. 3d Step. Subtract the <em>colder attached</em> Thermometer, from
    the other attached Thermometer, thus: 46 colder from 50 warmer, and
    there remains 4° warmer, viz. the Number of Degrees of Temperature
    to which the <em>colder</em> Barometer must be <em>expanded</em>, before
    it becomes equal in Temperature to the <em>warmer</em> Barometer: each
    Barometer being always supposed <em>equal</em> in Temperature with its
    <em>attached</em> Thermometer.</p>

  <p id="section_356">356. 4th Step. Give the <em>colder</em> Barometer the same
    <em>Temperature</em> with the warmer: or, which amounts to the same, give
    the <em>colder</em> Barometer that <em>Expansion</em> which is communicated
    by the Addition of 4 Degrees of Temperature.</p>

  <p>Both Barometers will then have the same <em>Temperature</em>, or
    <em>Expansion</em>, viz. an Expansion equal to the warmer Barometer.</p>

  <p>This is to be done by referring to the first Table, for the Application
    of which there are separate Instructions: see the Explanation of the

    an Inch) with a given additional Temperature, on Farenheit’s Scale.</p>

  <p class="center">The Question in the first Example is, (Ph. Tr. for 1777, Page 578;)</p>

  <p>To find the Expansion that arises, <em>with</em> the Addition of 4
    Degrees of Heat, <em>on</em> the <em>colder</em> Barometer resting at
    Inches 25 .19 Tenths, in order to give it an Expansion equal to
    that of another Barometer, 4 Degrees warmer than the former: the
    Temperature of <em>each</em> Barometer, being indicated by its respective
    <em>attached</em> Thermometer.</p>

  <p id="section_359">359. 1st. In the <em>first</em> Table, <em>with</em> 4 Degrees on the left
    Hand vertical Column, and with 25 Inches, along the upper Range; at the
    Point of Meeting, is the Answer .0101&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> viz. the
    Expansion, or Rise of the Quicksilver standing at 25 Inches, and receiving an additional
    Heat of 4°: the Answer .0101 being the Expression for the ten thousand
    one hundredth Part of an Inch, (viz. in Height, by Expansion.)</p>

  <p id="section_360">360. Add this Number, .0101, Part of an Inch, or Rise by Expansion, to
    the Barometer resting at Inches 25, .19 Tenths, Units under Units, &amp;c.
    thus:&nbsp; &nbsp; .0101.</p>

  <p id="section_361">361. 2d. Now, in order to obtain the Expansion <em>with</em> 4 Degrees,
    <em>on</em> .19 Tenths i.&nbsp;e. the nine hundred and tenth Part of an Inch of
    Quicksilver in the Tube (above 25 Inches,) it must be considered, where
    it ought to be found in the first Table.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

  <p>Tenths of 1 Inch, above 25 Inches, it must be observed, are at some
    intermediate Point between 25 and 26 Inches; that is, above 25, yet not
    so high as 26, or more than 25, yet less than 26.</p>

  <p>Therefore, to find the Expansion <em>with</em> 4 Degrees, <em>on</em>
    1 Inch above 25, i.&nbsp;e. on the 26th Inch; look in the Table, first,
    <em>with</em> 4 Degrees on 25 Inches: then <em>with</em> 4 Degrees on 26
    Inches. The respective Numbers are .0101 and .0105.</p>

  <p>And by taking the Expansion <em>with</em> 4° on 25 Inches, from the
    Expansion, <em>with</em> 4° <em>on</em> 26 Inches, thus;</p>

    24;) in order to prove whether the Moiety (or Quantity of Heat
    assigned to each Barometer by the <em>general</em> Temperature of

    Standard-Temperature of the Barometers, by the 2d Table.</p>

  <h3 class="hang">HINTS, ON THE CHEAPEST METHOD OF INFLATING BALLOONS, WITH DESCRIPTIONS
    OF DIFFERENT MODELS FOR A GASS-STEAM-ENGINE.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="pleft" id="section_429">Section 429.</span> THE <em>Expence</em> attending the Inflation of Balloons is
    a solid Objection to their frequent Use.</p>

  <p>A Check is thereby given to every Improvement that might otherwise be
    expected from a Repetition of Experiments.</p>

  <p>It is, in short, the chief Difficulty under which the <em class="smcap">aironautic
    art</em> at present labours.</p>

  <p>This Difficulty, however, if once overcome, (and of which there is
    little Doubt) will probably bring those extraordinary Machines, into
    general Estimation.</p>

  <p>What <em>now</em> costs fifty Pounds, may <em>then</em> be done for five:
    abating the Expence of the preparatory Engine.</p>

  <p>Mons. Lavoisier, by the Application of Steam to Iron Filings enclosed
    in a Copper Retort, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span> generated inflammable Air, or light
    Gass:&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
    and Dr. Priestley, by converting a Gun-Barrel into a Steam-Engine, has
    produced a Gass 13 Times lighter than common Air;&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137"
    class="fnanchor">[137]</a> whereas by the present expensive Method, with Metal and Acid, the Gass for Inflation
    is seldom more than six Times lighter.</p>

  <p>What has hitherto been atchieved on a small Scale, is here meant to be
    extended.</p>

  <p>As no Particulars are made public, or at least, have yet come to
    the Author’s Knowledge, relative to the Construction of such a
    Gass-Steam-Engine, as may, with Safety and Effect, be applied to the
    Inflation of Balloons; the following Descriptions of different Models
    may deserve some Notice:—may possibly excite the Attention of the
    ingenious; and put them on contriving <em>easier</em> Means to obtain the
    <em>same</em> End.</p>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p id="section_430">430. Let there be an Iron <em>Hot-hearth</em>, one Yard square, and
    two Inches thick. Let it be <em>set</em> on a Common Brick Stove,
    built as near the Ground as possible, (or even below it) in the open
    Air. Its Chimney to consist of malleable Iron, flat at the Top, and
    strong enough to support a Tea-Kettle or Boiler to produce Steam: and
    extending at least one Yard from the End of the Hearth horizontally,
    before it turns up. It may rise three or four Yards high, slanting
    farther from the Hearth: the Form a hollow Cylinder: with a Turn-Cap at
    the Top, two Feet long, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>set on at right Angles; for the
    Management of the Smoke.</p>

  <p>Supposing then the Fire-Place to face the West; the Chimney may project
    Eastward. The North Side is to be appropriated to the Iron-Borings or
    Turnings; and on the South Side is to be deposited the Dross or Calx.</p>

  <p>A Muffle or Mould of malleable Iron is to be screwed and luted over
    the hot Hearth. The four Sides of the Muffle next the Hearth are to
    have horizontal Lips or Rims projecting half an Inch: and Screws are
    to be driven, throu’ Holes drilled at proper Distances, into the
    Hearth. The Sides are to rise upright a Couple of Inches: closing, as
    they rise, in the Form of a hollow Cylinder, one Foot in Diameter,
    and perhaps a Yard above the Hearth: which is now converted into a
    <em>Gass-Steam-Engine</em>.</p>

  <p>It is proposed to strew over the <em>Hot-hearth</em> a thin Layer of
    Borings, one Tenth of an Inch thick; to which Layer when <em>red</em>
    hot, the boiling Steam is to be applied. The extricated Gass is to
    be conveyed from the Top of the Cylinder, by Means of an extended
    Trunk of Tin, and varnished Linen, into a Tub of cold Water kept
    <em>continually</em> flowing over, into which a few Lumps of quick Lime
    are thrown: and from thence the Gass is to rise into the Balloon.</p>

  <p id="section_431">431. The Iron, whether Filings or Turnings, proper for Inflation,
    must be <em>bright</em>; wholly free from Chips, Bits of Wood, and all
    heterogeneous Particles: but particularly RUST, and GREASE: <em>less</em>
    than a cubic Inch of the latter, woud spoil a Ton of the brightest, and
    otherwise the best prepared Materials. (<a href="#section_339">Section 339</a>.)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

  <p>A Day or two <em>only</em>, before a Balloon is inflated; the proper
    Quantity of bright Iron shoud be heated <em class="smcap">red hot</em> in
    <em>Charcoal</em>, and suffered to go cold.</p>

  <p>For Want of this simple Preparation of the Iron, the Gass has proved
    defective in Point of <em class="smcap">levity</em>: altho’ the Balloon appeared fully
    inflated.</p>

  <p>This Misfortune happened at Birmingham, and other Places.</p>

  <p id="section_432">432. The <em>Desideratum</em> is, <em>quickly</em> to apply, and
    <em>remove</em> the Borings, keeping the Machine <em>nearly</em> Air-tight.
    For, it is now well known, that the Gass will <em>explode</em>, if
    one-third Part of common Air be introduced: or, if less; it may
    <em>unite</em> with the <em>Gass</em>, and detract from <em>its</em> Levity.</p>

  <p id="section_433">433. The following <em>Particulars</em> may likewise be considered as an
    Improvement.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p>1. To lay a Plate of Iron, Brass, or Copper, over the Hearth; which,
    if made of <em>cast</em> Iron, will be apt to crack, in Contact with
    the Steam; and will also unite with and concrete the Iron Turnings or
    Gun-Borings into a solid Mass, that woud be separated with Difficulty.</p>

  <p>2. To make the Dross-Pit in the Form of a hollow Wedge, narrow at the
    Top: screwing and luting it to the South Side of the Hearth. It shoud
    hold the Dross arising from a Ton of Borings; which will be sufficient
    for the Inflation of a Balloon, to carry one Person.</p>

  <p>3. On the North Side is to be erected a Platform of Brick, a Yard
    square, <em>floored</em> with a Plate of Iron: the inside Surface to be
    even with the Bottom of the Hearth.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

  <p>4. The Ton of Borings is to be placed on the <em>Floor</em>, and covered
    with another Muffle, secured and luted to the Side of the Hearth:
    having a Communication of two Inches high, and one Yard wide, with the
    Bottom of the Hearth: as the Dross-Pit has.</p>

  <p>5. A Brass or Copper Rake is to remain within the two Muffles: to
    press forward the Borings, spread them over the Hearth; stir them
    frequently;—by turning the Instrument, scrape them into the Dross-Pit;
    and apply fresh from the <em>Deposit</em>.</p>

  <p>6. To perform these manual Operations within the Machine kept
    Air-tight; it will be necessary, at the exterior End of the Muffle, to
    fasten a strong leathern Case, made very wide and pliant, and two Yards
    long: into which the End of the Rake-Handle is to be inserted.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="center">434. <em>The Mode of Operation.</em></p>

  <p>The Borings being spread on the Hearth, and <em>red</em> hot; the Steam
    Pipe is to be opened, and <em>instantly</em> shut. The Gass being
    <em>suddenly</em> extricated; the Pipe is to be opened, and shut again
    as before: the Borings pushed into the Dross-Pit, and a fresh Supply
    spread. This Process to be renewed, till the Inflation is completed.</p>

  <p>If it be thought necessary to prevent the Steam from communicating with
    the whole Depôt of Borings, and so evolve too much Gass; a little Brass
    Door with Hinges of the same, might be made to hang from the Top of
    the Communication between the two Muffles: which Door opening inwards,
    and hanging vertically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> woud by the Pressure of the Gass, stop up
    the Open: and yet, if made strong, <em>not</em> prevent the Operations of the
    Rake, at proper Times.</p>

  <h3>IIII.</h3>

  <p id="section_435">435. The Machine woud be less complex, with one large Muffle, somewhat
    longer North and South than the Hearth; furnished with leathern Case
    and Rake. Put in the Borings at one End: keep the Steam-Pipe always
    open; with a <em>Hand</em> at the Rake; pushing away the Dross, and
    pressing forwards fresh Borings.</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p id="section_436">436. Further: it has since occurred, that a Machine in the Form of
    a <em class="smcap">gun-barrel</em>, <em>extended in all its Dimensions</em>, will
    probably answer <em>every</em> Intention.</p>

  <p>And of this Kind are the hollow cylindrical Tubes, of <em>different</em>
    Lengths, and about a Foot in Diameter,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> which are
    <em>cast</em>, for the Conveyance of Steam, from the Boiler of a Steam-Engine.</p>

  <p>Such a one, (previously lined with a Cylinder of Copper, or malleable
    Iron, to prevent the Adhesion of the Borings, when reduced to a Calx
    by the Admission of Steam;) might be placed horizontally over a Stove,
    (with or without a Chimney) and surrounded with <em>red</em> hot Coals.</p>

  <p>The Ton of Borings might be deposited at one End of the Tube; and, by
    Means of the Air-tight flexible leathern Case, be pressed with a Rake,
    <em>gradually</em> into the Fire, and <em>beyond</em> it when calcined.</p>

  <p>Care must be taken to make the <em>Apparatus</em> nearly Air-tight.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

  <p>The Steam shoud pass into the Tube, from <em>below</em>: and the Gass
    be conducted towards the Balloon throu’ another Iron Cylinder, nearly
    equal in Diameter and at right Angles with the first; lying also in an
    horizontal Direction; along the Ground.</p>

  <p>The Tubes might be <em>forged</em> or <em>cast</em>, so as to form but one
    rectangular Piece.</p>

  <p>The further End of the second Tube shoud communicate with a
    <em>third</em>, made of Tin, and bent downwards about a Foot; thence at
    right Angles, for six Inches: then to rise up, also at right Angles,
    the Length of six Inches more.</p>

  <p>The Tin Tube is to descend into a Cistern of cold Water, made to flow
    over continually, by a fresh Supply; and into which, a few Lumps of
    Quicklime shoud be thrown.</p>

  <p>The Gass, which will press upwards throu’ the Water, is to be received
    into an inverted Funnel, and thence (as in Section 339, Art. 2.)
    conveyed to the Balloon.</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p id="section_437">437. The following Alterations woud supersede the Use of the Rake, and
    <em>leathern</em> Cases: the latter of which, by any accidental Crack or
    Flaw in the Leather, might admit a sufficient Quantity of common Air to
    produce an Explosion.</p>

  <p>The cylindric Form of the Copper, or malleable Iron (to be used as a
    Lining for the Tube) is to be changed, into that of a half Cylinder, or
    inverted Muffle: and to be perforated with small Holes.</p>

  <p>This Muffle is to be <em>nearly</em> filled with a Ton of Iron Borings:
    (the Ends to be made up, to prevent the Borings from falling out into
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span> Tube;) the Muffle itself is to be supported by a Cradle&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> of
    the same Form, made of <em class="smcap">strong</em> Copper Wire,&#x2060;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> like the
    <em>open</em> <em>Iron-Wire</em>-Fenders: and the whole is to be thrust
    into the Tube.</p>

  <p>The Length of the Muffle depends on the Quantity of Borings that are
    intended to be used.</p>

  <p>The Ends of the Tube shoud not be made so strong as the Tube itself:
    that, if an Explosion happens, they <em>may</em> give way first,
    and prevent a Rupture of the Tube: not that any Danger is to be
    apprehended, that such an Event will take Place, so long as the
    Steam-Pipe is attended to, by a proper Person: the above Caution being
    only given, to prevent a Possibility of Rupture.</p>

  <p>Each End shoud be cast, or forged with a hollow Handle; and shoud screw
    into the Tube.</p>

  <p>The Length of the Tube shoud be such, that the Person who attends the
    Steam-Pipe, shoud feel no Inconvenience from the Heat of the Fire.</p>

  <p>Nine Feet woud therefore be a proper Length: the conducting Tube the
    same.</p>

  <p>Within six Inches from each End of the Tube which holds the Borings, a
    Hole, half an Inch in Diameter shoud be drilled across the Middle of
    the Tube, in an horizontal Direction.</p>

  <p>Into these, an Iron Axis is to be fitted, (so as to take out
    <em>occasionally</em>) and pass throu’ the Tube: each End of the Axis is
    to project outwards a Couple of Inches, and to be made <em>square</em>,
    for the Socket of a strong Iron Winch or Handle.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span></p>

  <p>Each Axis to be furnished with a strong Chain, of equal Length with
    the Tube; one End of which Chain is to be riveted, or otherwise
    fixed, to the Middle of the Axis; and the other, to be fastened
    <em>occasionally</em> to one Extremity of the Cradle and Muffle: the
    second Axis and Chain in like Manner, to the other Extremity.</p>

  <p>The Muffle is to be placed in the Cradle: both are then to be thrust
    into the Tube, and fastened to the Chain at the farther Axis: in which
    Position the Muffle may be filled with Borings, and gradually drawn
    into the Tube; till the same End has reached the Center of the Fire.
    The nearer End is then to be hooked by the nearer Chain, already
    wrapped round the nearer Axis: and the light Iron Caps to be screwed on
    each End of the Tube.</p>

  <p id="section_438">438. The Boiler for Steam may be fixed on any Part of the Tube near
    the Fire, and near the opposite Axis; so that one Person may attend
    both the Steam-Pipe, and Axis. The Steam to be conveyed throu’ a small
    Orifice made in the Bottom of the Tube, between the same Axis and the
    Fire.</p>

  <p id="section_439">439. As soon as the Materials, above the Center of the Fire, are
    supposed to be <em>red</em> hot, the Steam-Pipe is to be opened for a
    Moment and <span class="smcap">shut again</span>. The extricated Gass will be instantly
    <em class="smcap">heard</em>, rushing throu’ the Vessel of <em>cold</em> Water; and as
    instantly <em class="smcap">seen</em> to swell the varnished Linen-Trunk as it passes
    into the Balloon.</p>

  <p>The Steam-Pipe is to be regulated by these infallible Signals: and the
    Process continued, till that Quantity of Borings, that was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
    Center of the Fire, and consequently <em>red</em> hot, is supposed to be
    calcined.</p>

  <p>At which Time, the Handles are to be applied to the Axis, and the
    Cradle and Muffle drawn 5 or 6 Inches forward into the Fire.</p>

  <p>When drawn too far; Recourse must be had to the second Axis.</p>

  <p id="section_440">440. If great Expedition is required, two or three Conductors from the
    same Tube may be used: and, at the Distance of six or seven Feet from
    the Fire, <em>Tin-Conductors</em> may be added; taking Care that they are
    <em>made</em>, <em>applied</em>, and <em>continued Air-tight</em>.</p>

      <p>The Method taken for that Purpose was by placing the Hand so as to
        cover his Disk or Body, and then observe the Glory blazing round
        him; which may, in general, be seen to issue in great Abundance, in
        Rays of a <em>golden Colour</em>: occasioned by a Haziness or Vapour
        which pervades the <em>lower</em> Regions of the Air, most frequently
        in the hottest and calmest Weather, and in the hottest Climates. The
        Accumulation of these Vapours, before they are formed into Clouds, are
        often so great as to intercept the Sun’s Rays, or dye them the Colour
        of Blood: an Appearance frequent in Virginia, and also throughout the
        torrid Zone.</p>

      <p>By Degrees the Hand is to be removed so as just to have a Glance of the
        Sun’s Limb. And it frequently happens that the Air is exceedingly hazy;

        <em>two</em> Calculations in Section 52, Note <a href="#Footnote_18">Note [18]</a>, <em>corrected</em>; the
        circular <em>Distance</em> from the Eye, above the Clouds, was 102 Miles,
        1 Quarter, 320 Yards: while <em>that</em> above the Earth, seen from the
        same elevated Situation, (supposing the Day to have been <em class="smcap">clear</em>
        for such a View,) was 102 Miles, 1 Quarter, 307 Yards: whose Difference
        is only 13 Yards: that is, the <em>Distance</em> above the Clouds to
        the <em>nebulous</em> Horizon, was <em>rather</em> more extensive, than
        <em>that</em> above the Earth to the <em>terrestrial</em> Horizon.

      <p>It may not, to some Readers, be deemed either unentertaining, or
        foreign to the Subject; if the Distance of the <em>Prospect</em> from the
        Balloon at its greatest <em>barometric</em> Altitude, viz. 2332 Yards,
        or a Mile and Half within 33 Yards, be compared with the Distance
        which may be seen from the <em>Summit</em> of the principal Mountains in
        different Parts of the Globe.</p>

      <p>1. Cotopàzy, a Mountain in the Province of Quito, in America, and under
        the equinoctial Line, is <em>said</em> by Ullòa (Vol. 1. Page 422) to be
        3126 Toizes or Fathom, i.&nbsp;e. 6252 Yards, or 3 Miles and a Half and 92
        Yards in Height.</p>

      <p>2. White Mountain, called by the French Mount Blanc, near Geneva, is
        considered by Sir G. Shuckburgh (<cite class="upright">Phil. Trans. Vol. 67, Part 2d, Page
        598, for the Year 1777</cite>) as the highest Land in Europe, Asia, or Africa
        (known to Europeans) and calculated by him at 5220 Yards, or 3 Miles
        within 60 Yards above the Level of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

      <p>Mons. Bourit just returned from his last Tour, see his “Description de
        Glacieres” in 1773, makes the White Mountain but 5102 Yards in Height,
        (which is 30 Yards lower than Teneriffe) including the 410 Yards for
        the Level of the Lake of Geneva above the Mediterranean.</p>

      <p>3. The Peak of Teneriffe in the Canary Islands, which, <em>in
        approaching towards it</em>, Authors agree, may be seen at the Distance
        of 120 Miles at Sea, if the Weather is clear; (Modern History, Vol.
        14th, Page 451;) and, in <em>returning from it</em>, is discoverable at
        the Distance of 150 Miles, according to <cite class="upright">Glas’s History of the Canaries</cite>
        (Page 234);—has been estimated by <cite class="upright">Dr. Heberden in Madeira (Guide to the
        Lakes, Page 187)</cite> at 5132 Yards, or 3 Miles within 148 Yards.</p>

      <p>Glas remarks farther, that in sailing from Teneriffe, the Peak, at the
        Distance of 150 Miles is very little darker than the <em>azure</em> Sky,
        on Account of the great Quantity of Vapour intercepted between the Eye
        and the Mountain: and <em>not</em> because it ceased to be an Object too
        small for the Sight; or was in Fact, below the Horizon, and only raised
        by Refraction of the Vapour.</p>

      <p>With Respect to the Peak of St. George, situated in the Island
        called <em>Pico</em>, one of the Azòres; the Writer of this Account
        asserts, from the Mouth of an able and experienced Officer in his
em       some Weeks off those Islands; that the latter has frequently observed
        the Peak, at the Distance of 120 Miles, and coud then distinguish a
        <em>third</em> Part of its Height <em>down</em> the Mountain. Section 126,
        <a href="#Footnote_37">Note [37]</a>), see also <a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46">[46]</a> below.</p>

      <p>4. Etna is 3877 Yards above the Mediterranean: (according to <cite class="upright">Brydone’s
        Tour throu’ Sicily and Malta, Vol. 1.</cite> Page 211) or 2 Miles and 357 Yards.</p>

      <p>5. Blue Ridge, the highest Mountain in the Island of Jamaica, is,
        according to Dr. Clark, who measured it in November last, 3080 Yards,
        or 1 Mile and three Quarters, above the Level of the Ocean.</p>

      <p>The <em class="smcap">distance</em> to be <em class="smcap">seen</em> is considered as terminating

        (Euclid’s Elements, Book 3, Proposition 18;) and the Sides M T, and T
        C, containing the right Angle, are <em>known</em>; the <em>third</em> Side
        C M is readily found: (being a Corollary to the 47th Prop. 1st Book
        Euclid:) viz. having the two Sides of a right Angle Triangle given to
        find the <em>third</em>. Therefore</p>

      <div class="large center"><span class="gesperrt8">RULE</span>.</div>

      <p>Multiply the Sides containing the right Angle, each into itself:
        viz. 150 and 3958: add the Products into one Sum: from which extract
        the <em>square Root</em>; <em>equal</em> to the Length in Miles, of the
        <em>third</em> Side required.</p>

      <p>From the <em>third</em> Side, subtract that Part, viz. C H, which is
        equal to the Semidiameter T C already found: and the Remainder H M is
        the <em>Height of the Mountain</em>.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> Rays flowing from the Sun seem to be <em class="smcap">red orange</em>
        or <em class="smcap">yellow</em>, according to the Quantity of Vapours floating in
        the Atmosphere, which absorbs the most refrangible ones: and the fewer
        the Vapours the more does the Sun’s Light approach to a perfect and
        intense <em class="smcap">white</em>, according to the Doctrine of Newton: which
        seems to receive Confirmation from the Purity of the Solar Light, when
        seen <em>above Clouds</em> and <em>Vapours</em>, in the Balloon: where the
        Sun shines not so much with a <em>golden</em> as with a <em>sparkling</em>
        <em class="smcap">silver</em> Light.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> <em class="smcap">Sounds immediately
        under</em> the Balloon, seemed, as
        if originated <em>near</em> the Ear, and <em>louder</em> than they would
        have been heard, at the Distance of some Yards <em>only</em>, when on a
        Level with themselves: augmenting rather than decreasing, during the
        <em>Ascent</em> of the Balloon, till it arrived to a Height indicated by
        the Barometer at 27 Inches. Presently afterwards, the Balloon still
        rising; the Sounds <em>died away</em>: much sooner indeed than was expected.

      <p>The like was observed in <em>descending</em> from a State of perfect
        Tranquillity and Silence: <em>Sounds</em> from <em>below</em>, when about
        the same Height, <em>suddenly rushing</em> on the Ear.</p>

      <p>It must be considered that by <em>this</em> Time, the <em class="smcap">shadows</em>
        were much encreased; tho’ at half past II, they were <em>more</em> than
        double in Length to the Height of each Object.</p>

      <p>The Trees woud therefore spread a <em class="smcap">shade</em> <em>across</em> the Road.</p>

      <p>The <em class="smcap">tops</em> of the <em>Houses</em> likewise, being Part of them
        in the Shade; and either <em>thatched</em> with Straw, or covered with
        Slates of a <em>dusky</em> Hue; woud prevent their <em>throwing off</em>
        any <em>striking</em> Colour.</p>

      <p>Possibly the <em>Encrease</em> of Shade <em>alone</em>, might give the Face
        of the Country <em>below</em>, a <em>dark-green</em> Cast.</p>

      <p>It is certain that the Height of the Balloon must have been very great,
        to prevent the Sight of public and <em>Turnpike-Roads</em>, <em>above</em>
        which it <em>frequently</em> passed, and which had been <em class="smcap">plainly</em>
        seen <em>before</em> the <em>Re-ascent</em>.</p>

      <p>For suppose the Road but 5 Yards wide, which is less than the
        Truth; if it be allowed that an Object may be distinguished by a
        <em>sharp</em>-sighted Person, when its <em>Distance</em> from the Eye
        does not <em>exceed</em> 5156 Times the Diameter of the Object; i.&nbsp;e.
        when the Object does not subtend a <em>less</em> Angle at the Eye than
        <em>30 Seconds</em> of a Circle, (Smith’s Optics, Article 97) which is
        the <em>smallest</em> visible Point, and equal to the 8000th Part of an
        Inch on the <em>Retina</em>;—by multiplying 5 Yards, viz. the Diameter of
        the public Road, into 5156 (or, in round Numbers, into 5000) Times its
        Distance from the Eye in the Balloon; the Product is 25000 Yards: which
        Product being divided by 1760, the Number of Yards in a Mile, amounts
        to 14 Miles, and 360 Yards.</p>

      <p>Supposing farther, that a <em>common</em> Eye can <em>only</em> see an
        Object at <em>half</em> that Distance; the Height woud <em>then</em> be 7
        Miles.</p>

      <p>The <em>Improbability</em>, therefore, (on Account of the <em>Warmth</em>
        of the Air at that Height, viz. 60°;) of having <em>soared</em> to so
        great an Altitude, seems to point out, that the <em class="smcap">shadows</em> must
        have contributed a <em>principal</em> Share, in preventing a Sight of the
        public and <em>Turnpike</em> Roads.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> The <em class="smcap">magnitude</em> of an
        Object <em>decreases</em>, as the <em class="smcap">squares</em> of its Distance from the Eye <em>increase</em>.

      <p>At whatever Distance, for Example, the Eye can see any Object clearly;
        as at the Distance of a Foot, or a Yard, if the Object be removed to
        <em>twice</em> that Distance; it will appear 4 Times smaller than it did
        before: 2 multiplied into 2, equals 4, which is the Square of 2: in the
        same Manner, if the Object be removed to thrice the Distance from the
        Eye, it will appear 9 Times as small, as at the first Distance: for 3
        into 3 gives 9, the Square of 3: and so of any farther Distance.</p>

        the Pressure of Air on all Sides, from without, produces a constant

      <a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a>The different Phenomena of the <em>Aurora
        Borealis</em> may be owing to the Ascent and Motion of the Apogay, in the <em>middle</em>
        Region, over the Stratum of Eknèfiai or <em>Ground</em>-Winds.

      <p>The Effects of <em>Tides in the Air yet to be</em> mentioned, must not,
        however, be wholly excluded.</p>

      <p>The Aurora Borealis is seen in <em>Spring</em>, <em>Autumn</em>, and
        <em>Winter</em>: sometimes <em>culminating</em>, sometimes moving in
        <em>Streams</em> and <em>Waves</em> in the <em>superior</em> Regions of the
        Atmosphere: when culminating; as if rising out of Clouds in the North.</p>

      <p>This Appearance may be owing to warm moist Air perpetually generating
        between the Tropics, and rolling over the cold <em>dry</em> Stratum of
        Eknèfiai Winds, which cut off its Communication with the Earth: till
        accumulating over the Poles, it enlightens the Atmosphere, converting a
        six <em>Month’s Night</em> into Day; and returns to the Surface silently:
        or in Lightning, whenever it is communicated to the Earth, throu’
        <em>Vapour descending</em> by its own specific Gravity; or along with
        <em>depressing</em> Torrents of Air, known to be accompanied by frequent
        <em class="smcap">flashes</em>.</p>

      <p>When the Vapour is <em>condensed</em> in its Descent, by passing throu’
        a Stratum of the Eknèfiai Winds; it becomes <em>overcharged</em> with
        the electric Matter, <em>surrounding</em> and <em>adhering</em> to it; and
        deposits the Overplus in Lightning, on its Approach to <em>other</em>
        Clouds, or to the <em>Earth</em>.</p>

      <p>It is visible in the Form of a Vapour, when the Vapour to which it
        adheres, becomes overcharged with electric Matter, by Descent into
        a <em>cool</em> Eknèfiai Stratum below: there forming a luminous and
        transparent Atmosphere: the Particles of Light and Vapour being
        repelled to great Distances from each other at so <em>rare</em> a Height.</p>

      <p>It culminates above the Vapour, because less heavy than the
        circumambient Air: and may be subject to the Attraction of other
        Planets.</p>

      <p>The Aurora Borealis is also seen to issue in Streams and Waves of
        Light, with inexpressible Velocity, on its Return to the South, in a
        lower Stratum, as it <em>passes throu’</em> Interstices, between the
        Vesicles of warm Vapour, raised and dispersed by the turbulent Apogay
        Winds, in the middle Region.</p>

      <p>During Summer, the middle Region becomes blended with the lower, throu’
        Defect of Cold: and the electric Matter is supposed to be communicated
        to the Earth, silently, and continually; but by Lightning, when a lower
        and colder Atmosphere condenses and overcharges the Vapour, and cuts
        off the Communication.</p>

      <p>It cannot be seen but in escaping from Vesicle to Vesicle: nor, during
        Summer, after Sunset, on Account of the Twilight.</p>

        Degree of Heat would encrease or expand it two Parts and four Tenths
        more than the thousand Parts into which the Foot was divided.</p>

      <p class="center">CAUTION.</p>

      <p><em>The fourth Table properly consists of only nine horizontal Columns
        of thousands, in Breadth; which Columns are extended in Length to one
        hundred Lines, corresponding to 100 Degrees of Heat.</em></p>

      <p><em>The Table is here divided, in order that it may conform to the Size
        of the Pages: by which Means the Formation of each vertical Number by
        the following Rule, (which renders the Table</em> self-evident<em>) might
        without this Caution, have been attended with some Difficulty.</em></p>

      <p>The vertical Columns <em>below</em> the Figures expressing each thousand,
        shew the Expansion of Air <em>on</em> each respective thousand,
        <em>with</em> the corresponding Degrees of Temperature indicated by the
        Thermometer in the vertical Column to the left Hand.</p>

      <p>Example the first: to find the Expansion of Air <em>on</em> one thousand
        Feet, <em>with</em> one Degree of Temperature; the Answer in the Table
        is 2.4, or 2.43: i.&nbsp;e. 2 Feet and 4 Tenths of a Foot, rejecting the 2d
        Decimal as too minute.</p>

      <p>Example the second: to find the Expansion <em>on</em> 8 thousand Feet,
        <em>with</em> 99 Degrees of Heat: the Answer is 1924.56: and so of the Rest.</p>

      <p>Thus <em>any</em> of the <em>vertical Numbers</em> shewing the Expansion,
        may be readily <em>formed</em>, by <em>doubling</em>, <em>first</em>, the
        Number immediately under each thousand in the horizontal Line, for
        the nine first thousands, (of which the Breadth of the Table properly
        consists, exclusive of the thermometric Column) for the Expansion
        below it: and, <em>afterwards</em>, for each Expansion immediately below
        the former, by adding, to the Expansion <em>last</em> found, the Number
        immediately under its respective thousand.</p>

      <p>First Example: to find the vertical Number for the Expansion under the
        first thousand, viz. 1000, <em>with</em> 2 Degrees of Heat: the Number
        under 1000 is 2.43: double this: and the Answer is 4.86.</p>

      <p>Second Example: suppose the Expansion <em>last</em> found be that
        <em>on</em> one thousand Feet <em>with</em> 24 Degrees of Heat; viz. 58.32:
        and the Expansion <em>on</em> the same thousand, <em>with</em> one Degree
        of Heat more, viz. on 25 Degrees, be required; add the Expansion</p>

      <p><em>Any vertical Number shewing the Expansion may</em> likewise <em>be</em>
        found, first, <em>by multiplying the first Figure, or Number, of the</em>
        given <em>thousand Feet (in the horizontal Line,) into the Answer or
        Expansion on the</em> first <em>thousand Feet, with one Degree of Heat:
        for Example</em>;</p>

      <p>To find the Expansion on 9000 Feet with one Degree of Heat.</p>

      <p><em>The Expansion on 1000 Feet, with 1 Degree of Heat (from whence, all

        Expansions</em>, immediately <em>under the horizontal Line of thousands,
        are</em> formed.</p>

      <p><em>Then 2dly, any other vertical Number or Expansion may be</em> formed
        <em>by multiplying the Expansion</em> immediately <em>under the</em> given
        <em>thousand Feet in the horizontal Line, into the</em> given <em>Number

      <p>“<em>Precept the 1st. With the Difference of the two Thermometers that
        give the Heat of the Barometer (and which for Distinction sake, are
        called the attached Thermometers) enter Table I, with the Degrees
        of Heat in the Column on the left Hand, and with the Height of the
        Barometer in Inches, in the horizontal Line at the Top; in the common
        Point of Meeting of the two Lines will be found the Correction for the
        Expansion of the Quicksilver by Heat, expressed in decimal Parts of
        an English Inch; which added to the coldest Barometer, or subtracted
        from the hottest, will give the Height of the two Barometers, such as
        would have obtained, had both Instruments been exposed to the same
        Temperature.</em></p>

      <p>“<em>Precept the 2d. With these corrected Heights of the Barometers
        enter Table II, and take out respectively the Numbers corresponding to
        the nearest Tenth of an Inch; and if the Barometers, corrected as in
        the first Precept, are found to stand at an even Tenth, without any
        further Fraction, the Difference of these two tabular Numbers (found by
        subtracting the less from the greater) will give the approximate Height
        in English Feet. But if, as will commonly happen, the correct Height of
        the Barometers should not be at an even Tenth, write out the Difference
        for one entire Tenth, found in the Column adjoining, intitled</em>
        Differences; <em>and with this Number enter Table III, of proportional
        Parts in the first vertical Column to the left Hand, or in the 11th
        Column; and, with the next Decimal, following the Tenths of an Inch in
        the Height of the Barometer (viz. the hundredths) enter the horizontal
        Line at the Top, the Point of meeting will give a certain Number of
        Feet, which write down by itself; do the same by the next decimal

        an Inch,) with this Difference, striking off the last Cypher to the
        right Hand for a Fraction; add together the two Numbers thus found
        in the Table of proportional Parts, and their Sum subduct from the
        tabular Numbers, just found in Table II; the Differences of the tabular
        Numbers, so diminished, will give the approximate Height in English
        Feet.</em></p>

      <p>“<em>Precept the 3d. Add together the Degrees of the two detached or
        Air Thermometers, and divide their Sum by 2, the Quotient will be
        an intermediate Heat, and must be taken for the mean Temperature of
        the vertical Column of Air intercepted between the two Places of
        Observation: if this Temperature should be 31°&#x200B;1⁄4 on the Thermometer,
        then will the approximate Height before found be the true Height; but
        if not, take its Difference from 31°&#x200B;1⁄4, and with this Difference seek
        the Correction in Table IV, for the Expansion of Air, with the Number
        of Degrees in the vertical Column on the left Hand, and the approximate
        Height to the nearest thousand Feet in the horizontal Line at the Top;
        for the hundred Feet strike off one Cypher to the right Hand; for the
        Tens strike off two; for the Units three: the Sum of these several
        Numbers added to the approximate Height, if the Temperature be greater
        than 31°&#x200B;1⁄4, subtracted if less, will give the correct Height in
        English Feet. An Example or two will make this quite plain.</em>”</p>
